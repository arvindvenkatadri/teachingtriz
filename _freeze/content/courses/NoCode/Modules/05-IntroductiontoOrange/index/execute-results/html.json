Here is what it looks like:\n\n![Orange Data Mining GUI](https://orangedatamining.com/screenshots/tree-explorative.png){#fig-orange-datamining-gui}\n\nAll operations are done using a visual menu-driven interface. We drag and drop *widgets* that can have inputs and outputs. Widgets perform operations on data sent to them by other widgets. \nThe visuals can be exported to PNG/SVG/PDF and the entire workflow can be exported into a Report Form and edited for presentation and sharing. \n\nOrange also has add-ons that provide widgets for specific tasks such as Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis and so on. \n\n## Installing Orange\n\nYou can download and install Orange from here:\n\n<https://orangedatamining.com/download/>\n\n\n## Basic Usage of Orange\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/HXjnDIgGDuI >}}\n<br>\n\n## Orange Workflows\n{{< video https://youtu.be/lb-x36xqJ-E >}}\n<br>\n\n\n\n## Widgets and Channels\n\n{{< youtube 2xS6QjnG714  >}}\n<br>\n\n## Loading data into Orange\n\n{{< youtube MHcGdQeYCMg  >}}\n<br>\n\n\nWe are good to get started with Orange!!\n\n---\n\n## Simple Visuals using Orange\n\nLet us create some simple visualizations using Orange. \n\n- Use the File Widget to import the `iris` dataset into your session\n- Use the Data Table Widget to look at the data, and note its variable names\n- Use the Visualization Widgets ( Scatter Plot, Bar Plot, and Distributions) to look at the properties of the variables, and examine relationships between them. \n\n## Reference\n\n1.
