We\nwill use most of the packages that we have encountered so far and try to\nmake a polished info visualization with all the graphs, text, and\ndescriptions put together!\nBut first let us hear from the great Hadley Wickham, and see how all the things we have been doing fit into \"The Whole Game\".\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs >}}\n\n\n\n## References\n\n1.
