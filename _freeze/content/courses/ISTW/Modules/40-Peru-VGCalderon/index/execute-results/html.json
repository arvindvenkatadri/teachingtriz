Known as a proponent\n> of Spanish American literature, García Calderón achieved a global\n> celebrity for his dramatic, colorful, and ironic short stories. These\n> stories, published in both Spanish and French, feature a raw depiction\n> of reality, a strong sense of retributive justice, and a sympathy for\n> the marginalized people that characterize European Naturalism. García\n> Calderón adapted this style to advance his goal of providing European\n> readers with an authentic understanding of Peru and Spanish America,\n> thus replacing the voyeuristic and patronizing notion of the \"exotic\"\n> inherited from literary romanticism and nineteenth-century travel\n> writers.\n\n> The construction of García Calderón's stories was subversive and\n> destabilized the widespread notion of Peru held by European critics\n> and readers. While international critics during the author's lifetime\n> unanimously praised García Calderón's fiction as well as his essays\n> that theorize the transformation and renaissance of Spanish language\n> and literature by americano writers, scholars since the 1960s have\n> largely misunderstood his reformative project.\n\n## Story\n\nWe will read Ventura Garcia Calderon's short short story, <u>[**The\nLottery Ticket**](/pdf/ISTW/TheLotteryTicket.docx)</u>\n\n## Themes\n\n-   Marginalized People\n-   Colour\n-   Women and Objectification\n-   Mob Justice\n-   The Art of Protest!\n\n## Additional Material\n\n1.  **Kursi Nashin**: A Certificate of Discrimination from British India\n\n![](KursiNashin.jpg)\n\n2.

Those\n> fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a\n> photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood's\n> ideal of physical perfection.

Nimoy's previous book\n> of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the\n> models' slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of\n> beauty. The inspiration for *The Fully Body Project* struck when a\n> full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph\n> her and her friends.\n\nListen to Leonard Nimoy discuss this project on NPR:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/15912659/15912667\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n4.
