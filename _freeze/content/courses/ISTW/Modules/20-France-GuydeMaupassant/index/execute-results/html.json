Those\n> fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a\n> photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood's\n> ideal of physical perfection. [see also\n> <u><http://mashable.com/2015/02/26/body-positivity-get-involved></u>]\n> In 2007, Nimoy published The Full Body Project, a collection of photos\n> featuring nude women of many shapes and sizes. Nimoy's previous book\n> of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the\n> models' slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of\n> beauty. The inspiration for The Fully Body Project struck when a\n> full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph\n> her and her friends.\n\nListen to Leonard Nimoy discuss this project on NPR:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/15912659/15912667\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\">\n</iframe>\n\n4.

A Woman From Berlin\n\nBetween April 20th and June 22nd of 1945 the anonymous author of *A\nWoman in Berlin* wrote about life within the falling city as it was\nsacked by the Russian Army. Fending off the boredom and deprivation of\nhiding, the author records her experiences, observations and meditations\nin this stark and vivid diary. Accounts of the bombing, the rapes, the\nrationing of food and the overwhelming terror of death are rendered in\nthe dispassionate, though determinedly optimistic prose of a woman\nfighting for survival amidst the horror and inhumanity of war. This\ndiary was first published in America in 1954 in an English translation\nand in Britain in 1955. A German language edition was published five\nyears later in Geneva and was met with tremendous controversy. In 2003,\nover forty years later, it was republished in Germany to critical\nacclaim - and more controversy. This diary has been unavailable since\nthe 1960s and is now newly translated into English. A Woman in Berlin is\nan astonishing and deeply affecting account.\n\nIt has also been made into a movie.\n<u><https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/26/anonyma-a-woman-in-berlin></u>.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEZxcSf9HwM?si=RjKW33TpuFjZont7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n## Writing Prompts\n\n1.
