He looked to the future\n> with passion and interest, and although it is often believed the\n> opposite was open to change. Sometimes, even, he predicted them, as he\n> did with the cell phones of which in a story, baptizing them\n> \"teletini\", he had imagined diffusion and use. This is why the new\n> technologies that have enriched our lives today would also enrich its\n> own. And Dino would have fun surfing the Internet, tweeting,\n> photographing on Instagram. For this reason he would be proud of \"his\"\n> site which is now beginning to take its first steps.\\\n[- Almerina Buzzati \\@ <u><http://dinobuzzati.it></u>]{style=\"float:right\"}\n\n\n\n## Story\nWe will read Buzzati's surreal story, <u>[**The Falling Girl** PDF](The_Falling_Girl.pdf)</u>\n\n## Themes\n\n-   Beauty and Other Values in Society\n-   Classes in Society\n-   Ambition and Competition\n-   Fear of Missing Out (#FOMO)\n-   Surreal\n-   \"Inversion of Scale\"\n\n## Notes and References\n\n### Song for the Story !!\n\nWaheeda Rehman, the stunning \"**Falling Girl**\" in\n<u>[\"Guide\"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059246/)</u>\n❤️ !!
