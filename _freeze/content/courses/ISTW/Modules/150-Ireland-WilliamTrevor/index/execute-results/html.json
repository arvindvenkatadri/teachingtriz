He handles the intersection of childhood with the adult world so beautifully. To me this is a story both about the loss of innocence and, at the same time, the ongoing state of innocence that can betray us when we are young.\nI cherish the dreary details of the house, the oatmeal wallpaper, the way he describes domestic spaces and habits, and people’s physical traits. And that uncommon, perfect word at the end to describe the father: “rumbustiousness.” The story is layered and ambiguous, elegiac, brilliantly understated, impossible not to read in one sitting. It articulates the terrifying resentment, disappointment, and anger we can feel towards our parents, and the confusion and distress evoked by those very feelings.\n\n[–Jhumpa Lahiri]{style=\"float:right\"}\n\n\n\n## Themes\n\n- Families\n- Adults and Children\n- Parents are human too\n- Petty Jealousy\n- Personal Folly\n- \"From the Mouths of Babes\"\n\n## Additional Material\n\n\n### Notes and References\n\n1. <u>[**7 Writers share their favourite William Trevor story**](https://lithub.com/7-writers-share-their-favorite-william-trevor-story/)</u>\n\n2. Another good \"Dad\" story is this one by Grace Paley: <u>[**A Conversation with My Father**](/pdf/ISTW/AConversationWithMyFather-GracePaley.pdf)</u>\n\n\n### Song for the Story\n\nBilly Currington's Country hit from 2003, *Walk a Little Straighter*.\n\n>\"Walk a Little Straighter\" was written by Billy Currington, making it a very personal composition. This song is a highly autobiographical track, inspired by Currington's own childhood experiences. The song narrates the story of a young boy addressing his father's alcohol addiction. \"Walk a Little Straighter,\" tells about the pain and hope a child feels towards his father who is struggling with alcoholism. Upon its release in 2003, \"Walk a Little Straighter\" became a significant success, reaching No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. It marked the beginning of Billy Currington's successful career in country music.\n\n\n{{< youtube U1no7Or9BeI >}}\n\n\n\n<div id='rg_embed_link_446283' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='446283'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Billy-currington-walk-a-little-straighter-lyrics'>“Walk A Little Straighter” by Billy Currington</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/446283/embed.js'></script>\n\n## Writing Prompts\n\n1.
