Yamamoto's upbringing in an immigrant farming community and her\n> incarceration in a World War II U.S. government prison camp formed the\n> basis for some of her best-known stories, notable for their sensitive\n> portrayal of the emotionally and artistically constricted lives of\n> <u>[Issei](https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Issei/)</u> women and\n> intergenerational family dynamics. Oblique, often deadpan in delivery\n> and told with quiet humor and bracing candor, they reveal the love\n> affairs, madness, psychic and physical brutality that lay beneath the\n> placid surface of Issei and Nisei life. The subject matter, precision\n> and grace of Yamamoto's works have led critics to compare her to short\n> story masters Katherine Mansfield, Flannery O'Connor, and Grace Paley.\n\n## Story\n\nWe will read Yamamoto's story <u>[Seventeen\nSyllables.](HisayeYamamoto%20-%2017%20syllables.docx)</u>\n\n## Themes\n\n-   Inter-generational Conflict\n-   Living as an Expat\n-   First Love\n-   Teenage Romance\n-   \"Arranged Marriage\" (picture marriage)\n-   Deception...\n\n## Additional Material\n\n`{{% youtube \"I6MVtSZJhGE\" %}}`{=html}\n\n### Notes and References\n\n1.
