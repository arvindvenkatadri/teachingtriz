Cultural Capital <br> {{< youtube 5DBEYiBkgp8 >}}\n\n## Activities\n\n### Sharing\n\n1.  Sharing of CC: we will each of us take turns to reveal some aspect\n    of Cultural Capital that we directly possess: **Objectified**,\n    **Institutional**, and **Embodied**\n\n-   What is something that replicates from generation to generation,\n    biologically?\n-   Is there something that replicates \"non-biologically\"?\n-   How would you measure that? In what units, so to speak?\n\n### Re-Inventing your Own Game\n\n1.  You will be divided into Teams. Each Team needs to chose a wellknown\n    parlour/household or board game from your childhood. Set it up and\n    play it.\n2.  Then, you will be given a piece of Electronic Hardware called a\n    **Makey-Makey**. You will need to include this hardware in your Game\n    and extend the Game in a certain way.\n\n::: callout-note\n## TRIZ Concept: Su-Field Analysis\n\nWe will later tie this activity to the TRIZ idea of *Substance-Field\nAnalysis*. Perhaps you have a premonitory idea about this already?\n:::\n\n### <u>[Inventing your City](https://youtu.be/JW1kfoXtxzY)</u>\n\n1.  Making a Street Intersection Logo\n\nLet us take inspiration from this website:\n<https://www.cartogrammar.com/blog/maps-make-the-best-logos/>\n\n2.  Here are some instructions:\\\n\n-   Visit your home town on Google Maps\n-   Select a specific STREET INTERSECTION there.\n-   Copy paste the Shape of the Street Intersection into your favourite\n    image making software\n-   Create A LOGO for your city, using the Shape, such that you show off\n    some interesting aspects of your City, based on your own CULTURAL\n    CAPITAL.\n-   Three sentences to describe your Logo.\n-   See examples at the link above for inspiration\n\n::: callout-note\n## Serendipity\n\nThis course is about nothing if not about *serendipity*.\n<https://www.dictionary.com/browse/serendipity>. We will connect this\nlogo building idea with the idea of Metaphors in TRIZ.\n:::\n\n## References\n\n1.
