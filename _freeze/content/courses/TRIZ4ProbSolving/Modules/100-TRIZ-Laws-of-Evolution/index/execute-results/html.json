The ideal system has the desired outputs with no harmful effects, i.e., no machine, just the function(s).\n- Law of harmonization: Transferring energy more efficiently.\n- Law of uneven development of parts: Not all parts evolve at the same pace. The least will limit the overall system\n- Law of transition to a super system: Solution system becomes subsystem of larger system.\n- Law of Transition from Macro to Micro: Using physically smaller solutions, e.g., electronic tubes to chips.\n- Law of Increasing Substance-Field Involvement: Viewing and modeling systems as composed of two substances interacting through a field.\n\n## How Would you Redesign this Product\nTBD. Plot a set of Radar charts showing different stages of evolution of well known product lines. Obsolete products are even more interesting. \n\n## References\n\n1.
