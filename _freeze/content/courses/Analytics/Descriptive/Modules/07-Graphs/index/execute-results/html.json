What do you think? There are geometric shapes in there, and yet, they seem, all of them together, to convey an emotion, a feeling, and even a chain of events. Shapes convey many cultural ideas so it should not surprise us that graph and chart-making uses familiar shapes to convey information. But why do we do this? Why do we visualize data? Why do we analyze data? What is a data visualization? What are the basic types of charts? How do we map data to geometry?\n\n## {{< fa chart-simple >}} Why Visualize?\n\n-   We can digest information more easily when it is pictorial\n-   Our [Working\n    Memories](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/working-memory-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)\n    are both *short-term* and *limited* in capacity. So a picture\n    abstracts the details and presents us with [an overall\n    summary]{style=\"background-color: yellow;\"}, an insight, or a story\n    that is both easy to recall and easy on retention.\n-   Data Viz includes [*shapes* that carry strong cultural\n    memories]{style=\"background-color: yellow;\"}; and impressions for\n    us. These cultural memories help us to use data viz in a *universal\n    way* to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. [(Do humans have a\n    gene for\n    geometry?]{style=\"background-color: yellow;\"}[^1][)]{style=\"background-color: yellow;\"};\n-   It helps sift facts from mere statements: for example:\n\n[^1]: <https://www.xcode.in/genes-and-personality/how-genes-influence-your-math-ability/>\n\n![Rape\nCapital](../../../../../materials/images/rape-capital.png){#fig-rape-capital}\n\n![Data Reveals\nCrime](../../../../../materials/images/data-reveals-crime.png){#fig-data_reveals-crime}\n\n- Visuals are a good starting point [to make **hypotheses**]{.black .bg-yellow} of what may be happening in the situation represented by the data\n\n## {{< iconify bx analyse >}} Why Analyze?\n\n- Merely looking at visualizations may not necessarily tell us the true magnitude or ***significance*** of things. \n- We need ***analytic methods or statistics*** to assure ourselves, or otherwise, of what we might suspect is happening\n- These methods also help to remove human bias and ensure that we are speaking with the assurance that our problem deserves. \n- Analysis uses ***numbers, or metrics***, that allow us to crystallize our ambiguous words/guesses into quantities that can be calculated with. \n- These metrics are calculable from our data, of course, but ***are not directly visible***, despite often being intuitive.\n\nSo both visuals and analytics. And as we will see, we will not be content with that: we will visualize our analytics, and analyze our visualizations!\n\nLet us recall first what we meant by ***tidy data***:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Tidy Data](../../../../../materials/images/tidydata.jpg){#fig-tidy-data fig-align='center' width=680px height=400px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n## Tidy Data\n\n- Each **variable** is a column; \n- Each column contains *one kind* of data.\n- Each **observation** or **case** is a row.\n- Each **observations** contains *one value* for each variable.\n:::\n\n\n## {{< iconify material-symbols auto-graph >}} What is a Data Visualization?\n\n### {{< iconify carbon chart-network >}} Data Viz = Data + Geometry\n\nHow many *geometric things* do we know? Shapes? Lines? Axes? Curves? Angles? Patterns? Textures? Colours? Sizes? Positions? Lengths? Heights? Breadths? Radii? Textures? All these are **geometric aspects** or **aesthetics**, each with ***a unique property***. Some \"geometric things\" which we might consider are shown in the figure below.\n\n![Common Geometric Aesthetics in\nCharts](/content/materials/images/common-aesthetics-1.png){#fig-common-aesthetics fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n#### {{< iconify material-symbols function >}} Mapping\n\nHow can we ***manipulate*** these geometric aesthetics, perhaps like Kandinsky? The aesthetic has a property, an atribute, which we can manipulate in accordance with a data variable! [This act of \"mapping\" a **geometric thing** to a **variable**  and modifying its essential property is called Data Visualization]{style=\"background: yellow;\"} \n\nFor instance:\n\n- `length` or `height` of a `bar` can be made proportional\nto the`age` or `income` of a person\n- `Colour` of points can be mapped to `gender`, with a unique `colour` for each `gender`. \n- `Position` along an X-axis can vary in accordance with a `height` variable, and \n- `Position` along the Y-axis can vary with a `bodyWeight` variable.\n\nA chart may use more than one aesthetic: `position`, `shape`, `colour`,\n`height` and `angle`, `pattern` or `texture` to name several. Usually,\neach aesthetic is mapped to **just one** variable to ensure there is no\ncognitive error. There is of course a choice and you should be able to\n**map** any kind of variable to any geometric aspect/aesthetic that may\nbe available.\n\n::: callout-note\n### A Natural Mapping\n\nNote that here is also a \"natural\" mapping between aesthetic and\n**kind of variable**Quantitative or Qualitative as seen in @fig-tidy-data.\nFor instance, `shape` is rarely mapped to a Quantitative variable; we\nunderstand this because the nature of variation between the Quantitative\nvariable and the `shape` aesthetic is not similar (i.e. not continuous).\nBad choices may lead to bad, or worse, misleading charts!\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data Vis Components and Features](index_files/figure-html/fig-data-vis-r-1.png){#fig-data-vis-r width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the above chart, it is pretty clear what kind of variable is plotted\non the `x-axis` and the `y-axis`. What about `colour`? Could this be\nconsidered as **another axis** in the chart? There are also other aspects that\nyou can choose (not explicitly shown here) such as the\n`plot theme`(colours, fonts, backgrounds etc), which may **not be\nmapped** to data, but are nonetheless choices to be made. We will get\nacquainted with this aspect as we build charts.\n\nAs we will see, Data Variables may be ***transformed*** before being mapped to some geometric aesthetic, e.g. we may perform ***counts*** with a Qual variable that contains ***only*** the entries `{S, M, L, XL}`. We may also transform the `axes` (make them logarithmic, or even polar ) to create precisely the shape-meaning we wish. This allows us considerable flexibility in making charts!!\n\n## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Basic Types of Charts {#sec-data-viz}\n\nWe can therefore think of simple visualizations as [combinations of aesthetics,\nmapped to combinations of variables]{style=\"background: yellow;\"}.

And indeed, in R we use a philosophy called the **Grammar of Graphics**! We will use this grammar in the R graphics packages that we will encounter. Other parts of the Workflow (Transformation, Analysis and Modelling) are also following similar grammars, as we shall see. \n\n## {{< iconify eos-icons ai >}} AI Generated Summary and Podcast\n\nThis is a tutorial on data visualization using the R programming language. It introduces concepts such as data types, variables, and visualization techniques. The tutorial utilizes metaphors to explain these concepts, emphasizing the use of geometric aesthetics to represent data. It also highlights the importance of both visual and analytic approaches in understanding data. The tutorial then demonstrates basic chart types, including histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts, and discusses the \"Grammar of Graphics\" philosophy that guides data visualization in R. The text concludes with a workflow diagram for data science, emphasizing the iterative process of data import, cleaning, transformation, visualization, hypothesis generation, analysis, and communication.\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='../../../../../materials/audio/NatureOfData.wav' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
