    "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Year of Magical Thinking is Joan Didion’s account of the year following the death of her husband, writer John Gregory Dunne, and her attempts to make sense of her grief while tending to the severe illness of her adopted daughter, Quintana. As she tries to make sense of John’s death and her own changed identity, Didion discovers that grief is not what she expected it to be. Consumed by memories of the years they lived in Los Angeles, shortly after they married and adopted Quintana, Didion feels that she has entered a state of temporary insanity. Though cool and collected on the surface, she begins to believe that her wishes might have the power to bring John back. To this end, she refuses to give away his clothes and shoes, believing that her husband will need them when he returns to her. She calls this childlike belief that her thoughts and wishes can alter reality “magical thinking.”\n\nOf course we are not embarked on anything like this, but we do want to generate some “magic” in our thoughts! So taking some inspiration from her “childlike belief” that can “alter reality”, let us hark back to our childhoods and see what we can do with these objects below:",

Can you briefly describe and quickly sketch a few ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity-2: Some Shapes to Contemplate\nWhere do you reckon you can “see” these shapes ? Can you briefly describe and quickly sketch a few ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring your Ideas\nScoring is comprised of four components:\n\n\nFluency - total. Just add up all the responses. In this example it is 6.\n\nFlexibility - or different categories of ideas or, as Csikszentmihalyi would have us say, DOMAINS. Is your brick a Toy? Can it be used as…a Horticultural support thing? That is two domains, so two points.\n\n\n\nFrom https://houseplantjoy.com/bonsai-styles-fascinating-facts-about-bonsai-forms/\n\n\n\nElaboration - amount of detail (for Example: “in a bonsai” = 0, whereas “in a bonsai to create a root-over-rock structure as an island” = 2 (one for root-over-rock, two for further detail about the island structure).\n\nOriginality - each response it compared to the total amount of responses from all of the people you gave the test to. Responses that were given by only 5% of your group are unusual (1 point), responses that were given by only 1% of your group are unique - 2 points). Total all the points. Higher scores indicate creativity*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might have noticed that the higher fluency the higher the originality (if you did “good for you!”) This is a contamination problem and can be corrected by using a corrective calculation for originality (originality = originality/fluency).\n\n\nDiscussion\nBoth these activities are examples of exercises in divergent thinking. See the references for more information.\n\nDid you use the words “as” and “like” to describe your ideas?\nDid you not use these words to describe your ideas?\nWere there, in your opinion, any outrageous ideas presented? Why were they outrageous?\nAre metaphors more interesting when they are surprising?\nHow did the attributes of the objects ( shape , texture, size, weight, orientation…) get embedded in the ideas presented?\nWere these “embeddings” meaningful? How and why so? (Ask Bourdieu!)\nActivity-3: Gangs of Wasseypur\nWe will divide into two groups (four if necessary) and contemplate a brief description of the town of Wasseypur. There are 4 short questions / problems for you to consider at the end.\nActivity-4: Seymour Papert Constructionism Game\nhttps://arvindvenkatadri.com/courses/1-play-and-invent/modules/50-metaphoric-thinking/#activity-4-seymour-papert-constructionism-game-1\nActivity-5: C’est ne une Pipe\n\nWe will break up into groups of 4-5.\nEach group will be given a household object, perhaps an unusual one.\nYou need to imagine a use for it that is not what is the common known one.\nMarket it as a product that serves this new purpose. Make an ad.\nUse only Gen Z language in your ad.\nAd = Performance/Jingle + Poster\n\n(Articles: Book End made of Wood; Aristo Slide Rule; 80-year-old brass mortar and pestle; Node from Elephant Bamboo stem)\nActivity-6: Metaphorical Story re-Writing\n\nRead the story in Ref. 7 below.\nUnderstand the metaphors in the story:\n\nWhat is the story about?\nWhat “metaphorical language” has Joshua Ferris used to describe the characters, their actions, and the results of their actions?\nWhat is the domain of these metaphors in the story?\n\n\nNow, choose a (short!) story that you know really well, something that you may have encountered in school.\nRe-write this story using language, metaphors, and images from any domain (other than what may be in the original story).\n\nFor example, in Primo Levi’s lyrical story Carbon, a lot of metaphors from Chemistry and atomic physics are used to describe life, and connections with people.",

    "text": "The Creativity Systems Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\n\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi created what he called a Systems Model for Creativity, shown in the Figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some brief extracts from his book[Reference 1]\n\nMany of these books and articles have tried to answer what has been thought to be the most fundamental question: What is creativity? But no one has raised the simple question that should precede attempts at defining, measuring, or enhancing, namely: Where is creativity? On hearing this question, most people would answer “Why, in the creative person’s head, of course”.\n\n\nAfter studying creativity on and off for almost a quarter of a century, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that this is not the case. We cannot study creativity by isolating individuals and their works from the social and historical milieu in which their actions are carried out.\n\n\nThis is because what we call creative is never the result of individual action alone; it is the product of three main shaping forces:\n\na set of social institutions, or field, that selects from the variations produced by individuals those that are worth preserving;\n\na stable cultural domain that will preserve and transmit the selected new ideas or forms to the following generations;\n\nand finally the individual, who brings about some change in the domain, a change that the field will consider to be creative.\n\n\n\nSo the question “Where is creativity?” cannot be answered solely with reference to the person and the person’s work. Creativity is a phenomenon that results from interaction between these three systems. Without a culturally defined domain of action in which innovation is possible, the person cannot even get started. And without a group of peers to evaluate and confirm the adaptiveness of the innovation, it is impossible to differentiate what is creative from what is simply statistically improbable or bizarre.\n\n\nIf we think about it, the reason we believe that Leonardo or Einstein was creative is that we have read that that is the case, we have been told it is true; our opinions about who is creative and why ultimately are based on faith. We have faith in the domains of art and science, and we trust the judgment of the field, that is, of the artistic and scientific establishments. There is nothing wrong with this, because it is an inevitable situation. But by recognizing it, we must also accept some of its consequences, namely, that any attribution of creativity must be relative, grounded only in social agreement.",

Contrary to what you believe? Outright disturbing?\nI think this is immensely reassuring and humbling at the same time: reassuring because a creative act can be performed by anybody, not some arbitrarily defined “gifted individual”, and humbling, because if field members don’t like your act, or if you don’t have access to the field, you might not make it. It is fair and unfair, but immensely real.",

    "text": "Why this Model matters to us\nAs we will see later in this course, classical TRIZ was developed by Genrikh Altshuller based on an evaluation of more than 25000 patents. He found “design patterns” that had been repeatedly used across patents and classified them for our use. There is a strong sense of history and society right at the heart of TRIZ.\nFurther, the patents the study of which helped Altshuller create TRIZ in the first place belong with domains that we may not necessarily encounter. And yet, the Principles of TRIZ straddle domains and help “cross-domain” solutions to happen: the use of principles in one domain in another, unrelated, domain. (More when we enter TRIZ proper)",

    "text": "Some Examples from History\n\nBotticelli was for centuries considered to be a coarse painter, and the women he painted “sickly” and “clumsy”. Only in the mid-nineteenth century did some critics begin to reevaluate his work and see in it creative anticipations of modern sensibility. To what extent was creativity contained in Botticelli’s canvases, and to what extent did it emerge from the interpretive efforts of critics like Ruskin?\n\n\n…our view of Mendel’s contribution to genetics is generally quite wrong. The impression we have is that Mendel made a series of epochal experiments in the genetic transmission of traits in the 1860s, but that his creativity was not recognized by the scientific community until about 40 years later. This view is radically mistaken in a subtle but essential respect. (Brannigan) argues that Mendel’s experiments were not and could not have been contributions to genetics at the time they were made. Their implications for the theory of variation and natural selection were discovered only in 1900 by William Bateson and other evolutionists looking for a mechanism that explained discontinuous inheritance. Within their theoretical framework, Mendel’s work suddenly acquired an importance that it had lacked before, even in the mind of Mendel himself.",

Please enter your answer at the appropriate location.\nIntepretation\nThe Marvels of Priming\nAs is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.\nPriming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well. Furthermore, the primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most exciting pursuits in psychological research.\nThe Ideomotor Effect Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.\nIn an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University — most aged eighteen to twentytwo — to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others.\nReferences for Further Reading"

    "text": "Conclusions\nSo what should we do to try to overcome these ( and other ) Cognitive Biases?\n\nBe aware: Awareness is the first step towards overcoming errors in judgement. Keeping in mind the potentially harmful consequences of first impressions is helpful when meeting new people.\n\n\nSlow down: The second step is to deliberately slow down your judgement and any subsequent decisions. For example, never make a recruitment choice straight after the interview.\n\n\nBe systematic: Finally, try to engage your analytical reasoning skills by taking a systematic approach. This sounds trickier than it is. In the context of interviewing, you could prepare a list of essential criteria and force yourself to consider each one carefully before making a choice.\n\nThis helps us to not arrive at flawed ideas to pursue but ones that we are reasonably sure we can justify to….our Field, as conceptualized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi."

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation\nWe see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement / Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nRe-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power consumption centers are the urban areas and these are far away from the generation sites. This leads to capital costs in HT Transmission equipment; we go to HT transmission to reduce losses on the way. This is already a Contradiction, which we might solve using Segmentation to arrive at Local Generation of Power. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these costs. This leads easily to Solar Panels on rooftops for example. Again while this may be cheaper than the electrical distribution system, it still uses a fair bit of capex and space and is centralized per building. Can we take Segmentation even further and think of a hyper-local household-based power generation unit, using the Wind?\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around the home? Here below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that some these may sound naive, but that is exactly way to start!\n\nI would like to have access my generator, but it needs to be not too close to the walls for it to harness the wind.\nHow to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection wires get twisted?\nDo I need a conventional Commutator? Won’t that be heavy?\nWhat voltage and current will I get? Will it be compatible with my 230V AC mains?\n\nAs you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our attention. Let us cut to the chase and state perhaps the most interesting problem (to me!) that the inventors have solved as demonstrated in the video above. We will state this as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAdministrative Contradiction\n\n\n\nAC: Winds help to generate power by making something rotate, but winds can change direction and slow down the existing rotation.\n\n\nWhat would an IFR be in this situation? How “unreasonable” can we be? Let us try:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantIdeal Final Result\n\n\n\nTorque must be in one direction only (irrespective of wind direction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionUnidirectional Assumption\n\n\n\nI have made a strong assumption here about the the unidirectional movement: the main intent is for the rotating generator to be able to harness winds from any direction to establish or continue rotation in one direction (CW or CCW). Alternating current power generation is in principle immune to direction of rotation.\n\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix(PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTechnical Contradictions\n\n\n\n\n\nTC 1: Improve (15)Force/Torque while not worsening (3)Angle/Length of Moving Object\n\n\nTC 2: Improve (3)Angle/Length of Moving Object while not worsening (15)Force/Torque\n\n\n\n\nAgain we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters based on our IFR. Other metaphoric TRIZ Parameters that may suggest themselves are 12(Duration of Action on a Moving Object), 14(Speed), and (40)Harmful Effects Acting on the System.\nIs there a Physical Contradiction(PC)2 possible here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningPhysical Contradiction\n\n\n\nThe Rotor must yield and not yield to the Wind at the same time. In other words, the rotor must be “porous and non-porous”3 to the wind at the same time.\n\n\nLet us now apply the TCs to the Contradiction Matrix and obtain the TRIZ Inventive Principles."

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is what the Matrix suggests:\nFor TC-1:\n\n17(Another Dimension) !!\n4( Asymmetry)\n14(Curvature) !!!\n\n10(Preliminary Action)\nand with TC-2:\n\n3(Local Quality)\n9(Preliminary Anti-Action)\n35(Parameter Change)\n\nHmm…based on the PC, we may have expected a Separation in Space solution, suggested by Curvature, Another Dimension and Asymmetry. Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions, we try to map these back into the Problem at hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics, geography, and biology.\n\n(14)Curvature: Hmm…nothing new here, or is there? Of course the rotor has to be curved and kind of sphere-like….\n17(Another Dimension): A near-spherical thing has really only one dimension..the radius. And that points in all directions / dimensions! Should there be changes in radius then? Should the radius change create bumps ( positive change ) or depressions ( negative change?) Should the bump be like a welt, and the depression like a groove? How can a bump or a depression itself be curved, as 14(Curvature) suggests?\n4(Asymmetry): The bumps or depressions…..they have to be asymmetric? So….not like longitudes and nor latitudes, but may be like those great circles.\n\n3(Local Quality): OK, the bumps or depressions are already “local”….can we go further? Here is where I stretch and go hyper-local: Should there be structures on or inside them, like flaps or fins or vanes? How can these be asymmetric, then? By acting like miniature flaps or trapdoors, that yield / fall flat when pushed in one direction and stand up / resist when pushed in the other direction…somewhat like a dog or cat’s fur? Then push and pull work differently…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFrom Flaps to ….Funnels!\n\n\n\nMaking these flaps movable as the above paragraph seems to suggest would probably not be a good idea, from an engineering standpoint. But once we have the image of wind + flaps / fins / vanes and differences in pressure or movement, the Bernoulli Principle and Venturi effect suggest themselves immediately!! So what could this vane-fin-fur-flap thingy be then? Oh good heavens, a funnel !!!\n\n\n{HappyApple, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons}\nSo each of those bumps are segmented into funnel-like structures that cause differences in air pressure when the wind blow. These differences are unidirectional and create movement/rotation! And because the bumps are curved along the surface of the sphere, and they are not parallel to one another (asymmetry), at least some of the internal funnels will always be “in the wind” 4, and capable of creating rotation using Bernoulli/Venturi effect!\n\n9(Preliminary Anti-Action): What do we wish to guard against? Counter acting wind forces. Well, the funnel structures work only with wind blowing into the broad opening and so we are fine!\n\nSo finally we could just imagine a spherical object, mounted on a spindle, with spiral arc-like bumps at different places on the surfaces. Within the arc-like bumps are funnel-like structures that create differentials in pressure when subject to the wind, and that creates rotation. Since the funnels are asymmetric by nature, our final rotation is unidirectional. Whew! ( Yes, that “whew” is also very suggestive here 😃!)"

This is a Physical Contradiction! In this case we can easily see and application of Separation in Space and also Separation on Condition. However I think in this case, it would not be easy to arrive at the Solution using just these.\nThat’s a wrap! In the next episode of the #TRIZ Chronicles, I wish to step even further out of my area of expertise and dabble in HR! I think looking at some of the institution-building ideas in Ricardo Semler’s book, Maverick would be a good idea!"

    "section": "Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary",
    "text": "Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary\nThe movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast includes Peter O’Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden, and Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The editing of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. ( https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/ )\nLawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely well read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an expert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to his being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a lowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General that Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what kind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.\nHere is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this time.1\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the way to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct experience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a Harith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily rejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi Safra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears the camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid by Turkish airplanes.\nLater in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to retreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where the British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the Turks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the British navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there. Brighton simply scoffs at that idea, because the Turkish have 12 inch guns at Aqaba and the British have other things to do.\nLawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the Koran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the meeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to his intentions in Arabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own interpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not necessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is not in favour of the Arab Army’s retreat to Yenbo, as it would become one small part of the British Army. As a parting remark, Feisal says to Lawrence that the Arabs need what no man can provide, a miracle.\nHere is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene."

Provoked by Feisal’s parting remark, he sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about how Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting from where they were, and even advance if possible with British help. His detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of the Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba is a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai Peninsula.\nIn the early morning, seemingly in a eureka moment, he decides that attacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since the guns there could not be turned around.\nHere is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:\n\n\n\n\nLawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is Ali who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not consider Brighton as a member of his Field (as defined by Csikszentmihalyi in his Creativity Systems Model), but Feisal is a Field Member to Ali.\nApropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation and Elaboration stages of the 5 Stages of Creativity from Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration, Execution)."

    "section": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba",
    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as follows:\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k), we identify knobs or parameters within the situation and see how turning these could lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram for this purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if the British allies attack Aqaba, they may win, BUT they may lose a few warships. If the Arabs want to attack, they are too small in number and have no warships, and hence their chances of success are very slim. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take Aqaba without losing British ships.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define the Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the big guns there should have no effect.\n\n\nNote how the tone of this IFR is like a “eat my cake and have it too”. Very typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC). We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways2:\n\n- TC 1: Increase Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12) and not worsen Stability of Objects Composition (21)- TC 2: Increase Stability of Objects Composition (21) and not worsen Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba should not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Power(18) or Illumination Intensity(23) to “metaphorize” the effectiveness of the attack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could even stretch to making a Physical Contradiction(PC)3 happen:\n\n\nPC: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same time)"

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 24 (Intermediary)\n\nIP 40 (Composite Materials)\n\nand (TC2)\n\nIP 10 (Preliminary Action)\n\nIP 5 (Merging)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nHow are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an imaginative exercise as we map these Generalized Solutions back into the Problem at hand:\n\nIP 13: The Other Way Around. Change the Direction? Of what? Two aspects have “direction” as attributes: the attack, and the guns, which Lawrence can’t control. So how does he use this? Not attack by sea? Wait…ATTACK BY LAND!! Change the DIRECTION of Attack! So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too). Will this work? Yes, the guns can’t turn around!!\nIP 35: Parameter Change. But “ships” on land?? Note, the desert is an ocean into which no oar is dipped. Sand and Water are both Resources in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy are being substituted with the use of ….Camels!! And, metaphorically speaking, it is still an attack using ships….The Ships of the Desert!! So water becomes sand, and the warships become camels using Parameter Change !\nIP 10: Prior Action. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba and cannot do anything “in advance”. What could this be?\nIP 5: Merging. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali must recruit the Howeitat tribe “in advance” of their attack !! As Lawrence tells Ali, If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they might be 50 men other men would join. This is in accordance with what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, in advance of the attack.\nIP 40: Composite Materials. What object within the situation can we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British Army…so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite into one composite army.\nAnd, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a composite force with camels…\n\nSo IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a camel-borne attack from the landward side. IP 10 also teams up with IP 40 and IP 5 to give the idea of tribe unification.\nAnd so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba port from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and take it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!\nHere is the final solution in action !!\n\n\n\n\n I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up !!"

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Banff Wildlife Crossings\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation\nWe see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement / Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nRe-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up several problem statements. Let us state some of our Problems\n\n\nSignage would help drivers slow down, but slowing down may make journey less enjoyable.\n\nSlowing Down may improve animal movement but may endanger humans.\n\nClearing the Vegetation may make animals more visible, but may also make vehicles visible to animals and affect their movement\n\nAs you can see, many different problems and contradictions await our attention. Let us cut to the chase and state our Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Administrative Contradiction\n\n\n\nAC: We wish to drive at high speeds, but not kill migrating wild animals nor endanger our vehicles.\n\n\nWhat would an IFR be in this situation? How “unreasonable” can we be? Let us try:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Ideal Final Result\n\n\n\nThe Animals and Humans should both use the Road whenever they want without being mutually affected!\n\n\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradictions both ways1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Technical Contradictions\n\n\n\n\n\nTC1: Improve Loss of Time(26) and not worsen Duration of Action by Moving Object(12)\n\n\n\n\nSince our IFR is all about time, we have chosen the TRIZ Parameters that are time-oriented. We could have also tried the following:\n\n\nTC2: Improve Volume of Moving Object(7) and not worsen Loss of Time(26)\n\n\nTC3: Improve Other harmful factors Acting on the System(40) and not worsen Duration of Action by Stationary Object(13)2\n\nThese include Volume and External Factors which are not quite there in out IFR. Is there a Physical Contradiction(PC)3 possible here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning Physical Contradiction\n\n\n\nIn fact our IFR is nearly worded as a PC: The Vehicles and the Animals must use the Road at the Same Time."

Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions, we try to map these back into the Problem at hand. In keeping with the metaphoric/analogic way of thinking that TRIZ embodies, I deliberately use many visual hints here from math, physics, geography, and biology.\n\n3(Local Quality): So something that is local…local where? Well, along the highway, of course. So something that is located a specific points along the highway. Nice but not really clear enough to be actionable, yet.\n17(Another Dimension): Well, well. The Road is a linear thing and has length and breadth. What would we use for another dimension? Height, of course! So, we need to go either above the road or below! And that leads us to a …bridge and a tunnel !!!\n\nThe other Inventive Principles are, to me, not evocative enough in this instance. But we already have a decent idea: we could just imagine a set of Local bridges and tunnels that occur at Periodic Intervals along the highway. And that is exactly what Parks Canada have done.\n\nHere is the solution in action:"

    "section": "\n Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ is a system of Inventive Problem Solving created by Genrikh Altshuller. Altshuller, was born in Russia in 1926, made his first invention at age 14 (9th Grade), and was later educated as a mechanical engineer. At the time he started working on TRIZ, in 1946, he was employed in the patent department of the Soviet navy, assisting inventors in filing their patents, in Baku, Azerbaijan. While there he became intrigued by the question of how an invention happens:\n\nIs it a matter of luck? The result of a mental “light bulb” turning on, as in the comics? Or can inventions be seen as the result of systematic patterns of inventive thinking?\n\nAltshuller adopted an empirical approach to answering this question. He studied thousands of patents, looking for commonalities, repetitive patterns, and principles of inventive thought. As he found these, he codified and documented them. His results, when eventually published, attracted many enthusiasts who continued and expanded the work over the years, reviewing what is now estimated to be more than three million patents worldwide. TRIZ is actively used in Companies such as Boeing, Bridgestone, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor Company, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Hewlett-Packard, Illinois Tool Works, Inficon, Ingersoll Rand, Kimberly-Clark, L.G. Electronics, Lucent Technologies, Michelin, National Semiconductor, NASA, Philips, Rolls-Royce, Samsung, Siemens, Western Digital, and Xerox, among others.\nAltshuller found that the most inventive of patents did two things:\n\nThey stated PROBLEMS as CONTRADICTIONs (using just 48 unique phrases)\nThese CONTRADICTIONs were resolved across a wide variety of patents using an astonishingly few INVENTIVE PRINCIPLEs. (only 40 in number!)"

You surely saw the Contradiction: it is graffiti but claiming not to be! In TRIZ, the fundamental way of looking at an Inventive Design Problem is to discover and propose Contradictions. These are rendered in as simple and stark a language as possible…the starker the better!\nWhat sort of Contradictions do we see in these familiar objects below ? What is good and what is not so good? Could that be the source of a problem to solve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContemplate and note down for each Object: Does it embody a CONTRADICTION?\nYes, each one does, in its own way: The pizza box lid collapses on the pizza when it is hot and spoils the topping. The wrench must be turned by pushing against its narrower edge; we would find it easier and less painful if we could apply force on the broader surface of the handle. And the chain? Everyone know it needs to be stiff and strong to be able to pull the wheel, and yet flexible enough to go around the sprocket…and get horribly entangled, leading to greasy fingers!\nIn this way we look at OBJECTS, PROCESSES, METHODS, PRODUCTS, and indeed CIRCUMSTANCES to find CONTRADICTIONs!\nHere are some more examples in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnails\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat could be our Contradictions here?\n\nFresh Juice is good for health, but ads from juice companies wish to portray it as harmful, and they may not be able to sell!\nThe ground is hot for a snail, but above ground it is visible to predators."

This is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nIshikawa Fishbone Diagram\n\n\n\nThere are many versions of this diagram depending upon the DOMAIN it is applied in. This diagram is very helpful to us in assessing resources and processes, and watching how their interplay in a situation could lead to…a Contradiction."

    "text": "Determining the Administrative Contradiction\nIn the Ishikawa diagram, each of the items listed is considered a TRIZ KNOB, which is either in our control or not. By turning these KNOBs in either direction we can change a specific PARAMETER that the KNOB affects. This change may improve the situation for us but we may find that something else typically gets worse. This is the source of our CONTRADICTION for Situations. When this happens, we can usually state a CONTRADICTION in simple English.\nFor example: We want to boil milk, but we get bored watching it boil.\nHere Time and the Milk would both have been listed in your Ishikawa as Resources. You can further document your analysis of the Object or Situation using the following questionnaire 5W+H format:\n\nWhat does the problem seem to be?\nWho has the problem?\nWhen does the problem occur? All the time? Under certain circumstances?\nWhere does the problem occur?\nWhy does the problem occur? (“Ask why 5 times” – W. Edwards Deming)\nHow does the problem occur?\n\nThis will help in “aiming” the solutions that TRIZ offers, in the right way.\nSTEP1: In TRIZ, this way of expressing a Problem as a simple CONTRADICTION is referred to as stating an ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRADICTION (AC). You should be able to state an Administrative Contradiction in the following (loose!) sentence structure — Items in &lt; &gt; come from the Ishikawa and your 5W + H questions).\nWhen we, as &lt; WHO / MANPOWER &gt;, attempt to perform &lt; HOW / METHOD &gt; during &lt;WHEN&gt; on &lt; WHERE / MACHINERY / KNOB&gt;, we improve &lt;EFFECT&gt;, but lose out on &lt;negative EFFECT / KNOB&gt;"

Altshuller found that problems across domains could be expressed in a “TRIZ Language,” a set of metaphoric phrases that are an integral part of (classical) TRIZ. We will call these the 48 TRIZ Parameters. Some examples of TRIZ Parameters: Weight of a stationary Object, Loss of Substance, and Temperature.\nEvery problem could be described as a contradiction using some pair of these 48 parameters. These metaphoric phrases are simple enough and provide rich troves for imaginative problem solving. Expressing our specific problem in this way allowed us to see the similarity it has with problems in other domains and helps us to leverage solutions from there.\nSTEP 2: Take the AC and state it in terms of these 48 TRIZ Parameters, for example: Improve Loss of Substance and not worsen Weight of a Stationary Object ; Improve Loss of Information and not worsen Power"

    "text": "The Young Man’s Problem\nIn order to make a story out of this, I want make a Protagonist out the young man in the ad. It is he who has the problem and he who is going to apply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including the formulation of the Contradiction, Identification of Causes, the statement of the Ideal Final Result, and finally using the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix to find Inventive Principles, that lead to the solution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !\nFirst a philosophical digression:—\nSeveral authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse’s famous book titled Finite and Infinite Games speaks of Play, Types of Games, Rules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar articulation is, in my opinion, that of Mihaly Csikszentlmihalyi in his concept of Flow, shown here below:\n\n\nFrom Sketchplanations\n\nWhen the Game presents very little Challenge, we are bored. When the Game demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we experience anxiety. When the Challenge presented is just barely matched by our Skill, we are in the zone of Flow, or what I call Play.\nA good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:— that we live in a space where the Floor of Boredom is always rising and would crush us against our Ceiling of Anxiety. One Way to deal with this is to develop more Skills and push the Ceiling away, effectively moving into the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse suggests: When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.\nSo what does all this have to do with getting veggies?\nThe ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And not offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, “YM”) simply has to accompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will exaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young people likely to read this, and say that he would rather not be there but he does not want to hurt Mom.\nWe are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!"

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of a Visit to the Subzi Mandi\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation and see how turning these could lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if the YM goes to the market with Mom, he would most likely get bored, but would please Mom. If he doesn’t go, then he chills at home, but Mom is going to justifiably furious. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the Waste of Time, and being bored, and Stress at being away from friends.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The YM must go to the Market and not be bored.\n\n\nNote again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs practice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of Six Impossible Things before Breakfast ! Also note there could be other ways of specifying the IFR. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways1:\n\n- TC 1: Improve Loss of Time (26) and not worsen Effect of External Harmful Factors (30)\n- TC 2: Improve Increase Productivity (44) and not worsen Stress (19)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the Market may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Noise(29) as the “metaphoric thing” to avoid, but the current IFR doesn’t quite support that. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:\n\n\nPC: The YM must be in the market and not be in the market at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed squarely at one of the Assumptions in the Problem, that the YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nIn a future post, we will deal with using the PC and the TRIZ Separation Principles to solve Problems."

Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two squares for the TC1 have been circled in red, solving TC-1.\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1, TC2, both ways)\n\n1(Segmentation)\n35(Parameter Change)\n21(Skipping)\n18(Mechanical Vibration) (!!)\n2(Taking Out/Separation)\n10(Prior Action)\n\n36(Phase Transitions)\nand with TC2:\n\n3(Local Quality)\n14(Spheroidality/Curvature)\n9(Preliminary Anti-Action)\n37(Thermal Expansion)\n40(Composite Materials)\n25(Self Service)\n24(Intermediary)\n\nThat is a considerable list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions we try to map these back into the Problem at hand:\n\n\n35(Parameter Change): Which Parameter to change? Location? No. Sound? Change the “Bargaining Talk” into what? Sweet Musical Lyrics!!🎵🤣\n\n18(Mechanical Vibration) : What, make noise of your own? Yes! Play Music !!🔉 🤣\n\n14(Spheroidality): Wear “spherical” headphones!!🎧! Create a “sound sphere”! This is a long shot!!\n\n3(Local Quality): also indicates the creation of a “local” cocoon around the YM, but needs to be combined with 18(Mechanical Vibration) to truly arrive at the musical solution!\n\nOne could make decent interpretations of 2(Taking Out/Separation), and 24(Intermediary), but we are already there! The rest are perhaps (at least to me!) not very evocative, unless 37(Thermal Expansion) means “throw a temper tantrum at Mom”? Never! So there you have it! The Cinderella song played on Spotify becomes not just a noise canceller but actually seems to substitute the very conversation between Mom and the vendor. And the YM has successfully attained Flow ! And the IFR too, since with the music in his head, he is effectively “in the marketplace and not in the marketplace at the same time!\nAnd I attained Flow in writing this!!"

The point is that in the analysis of the Problem, we do need to ask Who has the Problem, as we did, and the IFR needs to stem from there. These alternative IFRs could well be the Voice of (another) Customer.\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ, please send me a DM! Thanks !"

To do this, we will use a set of metaphoric phrases that are an integral part of (classical) TRIZ. These metaphoric phrases are simple enough and provide rich troves for imaginative problem solving.\nBefore we study this TRIZ Contradiction Language however, we need to obtain a quick understanding of its history.",

    "section": "The History of TRIZ",
    "text": "The History of TRIZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creator of TRIZ, Genrich Altshuller, was born in Russia in 1926, made his first invention at age 14 (9th Grade), and was later educated as a mechanical engineer. At the time he started working on TRIZ, in 1946, he was employed in the patent department of the Soviet navy, assisting inventors in filing their patents, in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nWhile there he became intrigued by the question of how an invention happens:\n\nIs it a matter of luck? The result of a mental “light bulb” turning on, as in the comics? Or can inventions be seen as the result of systematic patterns of inventive thinking?\n\nAltshuller adopted an empirical approach to answering this question. He studied thousands of patents, looking for commonalities, repetitive patterns, and principles of inventive thought. As he found them he codified and documented them, as shown below. His results, when eventually published, attracted many enthusiasts who continued and expanded the work over the years, reviewing what is now estimated to be more than two million patents worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Apparent Solution. This level requires no real invention; it consists of minor adaptations of existing concepts. Simple improvement of a technical system. They require knowledge available within an industry relevant to that system.\nLevel 2: Improvement. This level makes small improvements to existing approaches. Inventions include the resolution of a technical contradiction(TC). They require knowledge from different areas within an industry relevant to the system.\nLevel 3: Invention Inside the Paradigm. This level uses methods from other fields and improves previous approaches. This is an invention containing a resolution of a physical contradiction(PC). It requires knowledge from other industries.\nLevels #2 & #3 solve contradictions and therefore are innovative by definition.\nLevel 4. Invention Outside the Paradigm. This level involves a new design that is based on modifications of existing principles but in a manner not previously used. This level involves development a new technology. It is developed by using breakthrough solutions that requires knowledge from different fields of science. This fourth level also improves upon a technical system, but without solving an existing technical problem. Instead, it improves the function by replacing the original technology with a new technology. For example a mechanical system is replaced with a chemical system to perform the function.\nLevel 5: Discovery. This is the highest invention level. It consists of completely new concepts using new principles, and involves the discovery of new phenomena. The new phenomenon is discovered that allows pushing the existing technology to a higher level.\nAltshuller concluded from his research that a large number of patents (77%) belong only to Levels #1 and #2. The practical utilization of TRIZ methodology can help inventors elevate their innovative solutions to Levels #3 and #4. As a result of this work, hundreds of technical papers and many books on TRIZ have been published, including 14 books by Altshuller himself.\nTRIZ is actively used in Companies such as Boeing, Bridgestone, Eastman Kodak, Ford Motor Company, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Hewlett-Packard, Illinois Tool Works, Inficon, Ingersoll Rand, Kimberly-Clark, L.G. Electronics, Lucent Technologies, Michelin, National Semiconductor, NASA, Philips, Rolls-Royce, Samsung, Siemens, Western Digital, and Xerox among others.",

    "text": "Speaking TRIZ\nAltshuller made two more discoveries (at least!) based on his study of Soviet Patents:\n\nThat when the the problems solved in the patents were expressed as Contradictions, there were only a few standard phrases using which these Contradictions could be constructed. These were an astonishingly small 48 in number!! Every problem could be described as a contradiction using some pair of these 48 parameters. We will call these the 48 TRIZ Parameters1.\nWhen the solutions in the Patents were examined, they could all be expressed simply as one of 40 abstract nouns or phrases. Just…40! We will call these the 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles\n\nSome examples:\n\nTRIZ Parameters: Weight of an stationary Object, Loss of Substance, and Temperature.\n\nTRIZ Inventive Principles: Asymmetry, Parameter Change and The Other Way Around.\n\nSo the task is:\n\nTake your Administrative Contradiction (AC)\n\nConvert “each side” (i.e terms) of the AC into a TRIZ Technical Contradiction by using a pair of the 48 TRIZ Parameters.\n\nMake sure that you are able to justify to yourself the metaphorical connection between the terms of AC and the chosen pair of TRIZ Parameters. For example, “Loss of substance” could mean “loss of money”!! Write this down, for both sides of your AC.\n\nWe may be able to also create a Physical Contradiction at this time, when we are examining the Ishikawa knobs.",

    "section": "Some Contradiction Examples",
    "text": "Some Contradiction Examples\nTC Examples:\n\nIncreasing the power of an engine (positive improvement) requires an increase in the size of the engine (negative effect). So, an inventor considers increasing the power partially in order to reduce the negative effect (compromise solution).\n\nTo increase the speed of an airplane, a new and more powerful engine is installed. This increases the weight of the airplane so the wings can no longer support it during takeoff. Increasing the wing size produces more drag, slowing the airplane down.\n\nPC Examples:\n\nLanding gear must be present on an airplane in order to land and takeoff. It should not be present during flight because of an increase in air drag. The physical contradiction is that the landing gear must be both present and absent. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in time — make the landing gear retractable.\nFor high water diving, water must be “hard” to support the diver and “soft” so as not to injure the diver. The physical contradiction: The water must be hard and soft at the same time. This contradiction is resolved by separating the requirements in space: Saturate the water with air bubbles — the pool contains both air and water.\n… an inherent contradiction in takeout pizza products. The customer wants the pizza to be hot, but hot pizza gives off steam. As a result, the cardboard box lid absorbs the steam, softens, and collapses down on the pizza. When the customer lifts the lid of the pizza box after arriving home, some of the pizza, which has stuck to the lid, attaches to the raised lid and the customer is not pleased because a significant amount of the cheese that he paid for is not edible. We want the pizza to be hot for one reason (an enjoyable pizza) and we want it to be cold for another (preventing the lid from becoming soggy and collapsing due to steam and water absorption). The little plastic tripod that is in the center of many takeout pizzas was the subject of the talk I heard. Such a simple invention! It resolves the contradiction of the pizza being hot and cold at the same time. (Jack Hipple, The Ideal Result)",

The SEQUENCE in which we encounter them colours our opinion of the person whom they describe. So first impressions do seem to be last impressions! This is a Cognitive Bias the Halo Effect at work.

    "text": "Bias #3 Priming\nGame\nYou will be given a small questionnaire PDF, with a single multiple-choice question. Please enter your answer at the appropriate location.\nIntepretation\nThe Marvels of Priming\nAs is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.\nPriming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well. Furthermore, the primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most exciting pursuits in psychological research.\nThe Ideomotor Effect Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.\nIn an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University — most aged eighteen to twentytwo — to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others.\nReferences for Further Reading",

    "text": "Conclusions\nSo what should we do to try to overcome these ( and other ) Cognitive Biases?\n\nBe aware: Awareness is the first step towards overcoming errors in judgement. Keeping in mind the potentially harmful consequences of first impressions is helpful when meeting new people.\n\n\nSlow down: The second step is to deliberately slow down your judgement and any subsequent decisions. For example, never make a recruitment choice straight after the interview.\n\n\nBe systematic: Finally, try to engage your analytical reasoning skills by taking a systematic approach. This sounds trickier than it is. In the context of interviewing, you could prepare a list of essential criteria and force yourself to consider each one carefully before making a choice.\n\nThis helps us to not arrive at flawed ideas to pursue but ones that we are reasonably sure we can justify to….our Field, as conceptualized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.",

    "text": "Discussion\n\nProblems and Contradictions\nAll Available Resources\n\nAssumptions and Functional Fixedness\n\n\n\nA comparable switch of attention occurs in an old joke about a worker in a high security factory, in which the employees were carefully watched when they left at the end of their work day. On a particular day, this worker was stopped at the factory gate as he walked out with a wheelbarrow full of styrofoam packing peanuts. He explained that he had salvaged these from the trash, and was planning to use them in shipping gifts to his grandchildren. Searching through this packing material, the guards found nothing, and so they let the man go home. The following week the same thing happened, and the worker was again stopped. But he offered the very same story, and when the guards searched through the packing peanuts and found nothing, he was allowed to leave. But this continued, week after week, until the guards could no longer believe that one person would want or could make use of so much packing material. Finally, the man was held for interrogation, at which time he admitted that he had absolutely no use for packing peanuts - and that, all these weeks, he had been stealing wheelbarrows.\n\n\nHearing this joke, I am reminded of the phrase “part and parcel”, which is a rough equivalent of “figure and ground”, the Gestalt Principles. Throughout most of it, the packing peanuts occupy center stage as figure (part), while the wheelbarrows (which function merely as containers) are completely ignored as innocuous ground (parcel). At the end of the joke, there is an unexpected twist, a switch of emphasis, a recentering, when we learn that the parcel is really the part.\n\nThis should also remind us of the Guilford Alternative Uses Exercise that we did, where we forced ourselves to leave the “regular use” of an object behind and think of it as serving quite another function.",
