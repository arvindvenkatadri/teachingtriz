    "section": "Graph Metaphors",
    "text": "Graph Metaphors\nNetwork graphs are characterized by two key terms: nodes and edges\n\n\nNodes : Entities\n\nMetaphors: Individual People? Things? Ideas? Places? to be connected in the network.\nSynonyms: vertices. Nodes have IDs.\n\n\n\nEdges: Connections\n\nMetaphors: Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Letters sent and received? Dependence? between the entities.\nSynonyms: links, ties.\n\n\n\nIn R, we create network representations using node and edge information. One way in which these could be organized are:\n\n\nNode list: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs found in the edge list. You can also add attribute columns to the data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables. ( Type? Class? Family? Country? Subject? Race? )\n\n\nNode Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nNode Name\nAttribute? Qualities?Categories? Family? Country?Planet?\n\n\n1\nNed\nNursery School Teacher\n\n\n2\nJaguar Paw\nMain Character, Apocalypto\n\n\n3\nJohn Snow\nEpidemiologist\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge list: data frame containing two columns: source node and destination node of an edge. Source and Destination have node IDs.\n\nWeighted network graph: An edge list can also contain additional columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered weighted.\n\n\nEdges Table\n\nFrom\nTo\nRelationship\nWeightage\n\n\n\n1\n3\nFinancial Dealings\n6\n\n\n2\n1\nHistory Lessons\n2\n\n\n2\n3\nVaccination\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nLayout: A geometric arrangement of nodes and edges.\n\nMetaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour? Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the arrangement.\n\n\n\nLayout Algorithms : Method to arranges nodes and edges with the aim of optimizing some metric .\n\nMetaphors: Nodes are masses and edges are springs. The Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all springs.(BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all springs?…)\n\n\nDirected and undirected network graph: If the distinction between source and target is meaningful, the network is directed. If the distinction is not meaningful, the network is undirected. Directed edges represent an ordering of nodes, like a relationship extending from one node to another, where switching the direction would change the structure of the network. Undirected edges are simply links between nodes where order does not matter.\n\nExamples:\n - The World Wide Web is an example of a directed network because\n hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily \n the other way around.\n\n - Co-authorship networks represent examples of un-directed networks,\nwhere nodes are authors and they are connected by an edge if they\nhave written a publication together\n\n - When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the\nsender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful,\ntherefore the network is directed.\n\n\nConnected and Disconnected graphs: If there is some path from any node to any other node, the Networks is said to be Connected. Else, Disconnected."

Graph Data setup and manipulation is done in tidygraph and graph visualization with ggraph.\n\n\ntidygraph Data -> “Network Object” in R.\n\nggraph Network Object -> Plots using a chosen layout/algo.\n\nBoth leverage the power of igraph, which is the Big Daddy of all network packages. We will be using the Grey’s Anatomy dataset in our first foray into networks.\nStep1. Read the data\nDownload these two datasets into your current project-> data folder.\n Grey’s Anatomy Nodes \n Grey’s Anatomy Edges \n\ngrey_nodes <- read_csv(\"data/grey_nodes.csv\")\ngrey_edges <- read_csv(\"data/grey_edges.csv\")\n\ngrey_nodes\ngrey_edges\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Inferences #1\n\n\n\nLook at the console output thumbnail.

Understand the data in both nodes and edges as shown in the second and third thumbnails. Write some comments and inferences here.\n\n\nStep 2.Create a network object using tidygraph:\nKey function:\n\n\ntbl_graph(): (aka “tibble graph”). Key arguments: nodes, edges and directed.

More elaborate plot\nKey functions:\n\n\nggraph(layout = \"......\"): Create classic node-edge diagrams; i.e. Sets up the graph. Rather like ggplot for networks!\n\nTwo kinds of geom: one set for nodes, and another for edges\n\ngeom_node_point(aes(.....)): Draws node as “points”. Alternatives are circle / arc_bar / tile / voronoi. Remember the geoms that we have seen before in Grammar of Graphics!\ngeom_edge_link(aes(.....)): Draws edges as “links”.

Aesthetic Mapping from Node and Edge attribute columns\nUp to now, we have assigned specific numbers to geometric aesthetics such as shape and size. Now we are ready ( maybe ?) change the meaning and significance of the entire graph and each element within it, and use aesthetics / metaphoric mappings to achieve new meanings or insights. Let us try using aes() inside each geom to map a variable to a geometric aspect.\nDon’t try to use more than 2 aesthetic mappings simultaneously!!\nThe node elements we can tweak are:\n\nTypes of Nodes: geom_node_****()\n\nNode Parameters: inside geom_node_****(aes(...............))\n-aes(alpha  = node-variable) : opacity; a value between 0 and 1\n-aes(shape  = node-variable) : node shape\n-aes(colour = node-variable) : node colour\n-aes(fill   = node-variable) : fill colour for node\n-aes(size   = node-variable) : size of node\n\nThe edge elements we can tweak are:\n\nType of Edges” geom_edge_****()\n\nEdge Parameters: inside geom_edge_****(aes(...............))\n-aes(colour = edge-variable) : colour of the edge\n-aes(width  = edge-variable) : width of the edge\n-aes(label  = some_variable) : labels for the edge\n\nType ?geom_node_point and ?geom-edge_link in your Console for more information.\n\nggraph(graph = ga, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + # change variable here\n  \n  geom_node_point(aes(color = race), size = 6) + # change variable here\n\n\n  labs(title = \"Whoo Hoo! Yet another Grey's Anatomy graph in R!\") +\n  \n  set_graph_style() # Why is the previously set graph style not work here???\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Inferences #6\n\n\n\nDescribe some of the changes here. What types of edges worked? Which variables were you able to use for nodes and edges and how? What did not work with either of the two?"

Make graphs wiggle and shake using tidy commands! The package implements interactivity using the physical metaphor of weights and springs we discussed earlier.\nThe visNetwork() function uses a nodes list and edges list to create an interactive graph. The nodes list must include an “id” column, and the edge list must have “from” and “to” columns. The function also plots the labels for the nodes, using the names of the cities from the “label” column in the node list.\n\nlibrary(visNetwork)\n\n# Prepare the data for plotting by visNetwork\ngrey_nodes\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngrey_edges\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Relabel greys anatomy nodes and edges for VisNetwork\ngrey_nodes_vis <- grey_nodes %>% \n  rowid_to_column(var = \"id\") %>% \n  rename(\"label\" = name) %>% \n  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == \"F\" ~ \"Female\",\n                         sex == \"M\" ~ \"Male\")) %>% \n  replace_na(., list(sex = \"Transgender?\")) %>% \n  rename(\"group\" = sex)\ngrey_nodes_vis\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngrey_edges_vis <- grey_edges %>% \n  select(from, to) %>% \n  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, \n            by = c(\"from\" = \"label\")) %>% \n  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, \n            by = c(\"to\" = \"label\")) %>%\n  select(\"from\"= id.x, \"to\" = id.y)\ngrey_edges_vis\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUsing fontawesome icons\n\ngrey_nodes_vis %>%\n\n  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis) %>% \n  visNodes(font = list(size = 40)) %>% \n  \n  # Colour and icons for each of the gender-groups\n  visGroups(groupname = \"Female\", shape = \"icon\", \n            icon = list(code = \"f182\", size = 75, color = \"tomato\"),\n            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  visGroups(groupname = \"Male\", shape = \"icon\", \n            icon = list(code = \"f183\", size = 75, color = \"slateblue\"), \n            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  visGroups(groupname = \"Transgender?\", shape = \"icon\", \n            icon = list(code = \"f22c\", size = 75, color = \"fuchsia\"), \n            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  #visLegend() %>%\n  #Add the fontawesome icons!!\n  addFontAwesome() %>% \n  \n  # Add Interaction Controls\n  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,\n                 hover = TRUE,\n                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,\n                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,\n                 zoomView = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another family of icons available in visNetwork, called ionicons.

We will of course examine geometric metaphors that can represent various classes of entities and their relationships.\nNetwork graphs can be rendered both as static and interactive and we will examine R packages that render both kinds of plots.\nThere is a another kind of structure: one that combines spatial and network data in one.

    "text": "What sort of Plots can we make for Categorical Data?\nWe have already seen bar plots, which allow us to plot counts of categorical data. However, if there are a large number of categorical variables or if the categorical variables have many levels, the bar plot is not adequate.\nFrom Michael Friendly:\n\nThe familiar techniques for displaying raw data are often disappointing when applied to categorical data. The simple scatterplot, for example, widely used to show the relation between quantitative response and predictors, when applied to discrete variables, gives a display of the category combinations, with all identical values overplotted, and no representation of their frequency.\n\n\nInstead, frequencies of categorical variables are often best represented graphically using areas rather than as position along a scale. Using the visual attribute:\n\n\\[\\pmb{area \\sim frequency}\\]\n\nallows creating novel graphical displays of frequency data for special circumstances.\n\nLet us not look at some sample plots that embody this “area-frequency* principle.\nMosaic Plots\nA mosaic plot is basically an area-proportional visualization of (typically observed) frequencies, consisting of tiles (corresponding to the cells) created by vertically and horizontally splitting a rectangle recursively. Thus, the area of each tile is proportional to the corresponding cell entry given the dimensions of previous splits.\nThe vcd::mosaic() function needs the data in contingency table form. We will use our vcd::structable() function to construct one:\n\nart <- vcd::structable(~ Treatment + Improved, data = Arthritis)\nart\n\n          Improved None Some Marked\nTreatment                          \nPlacebo              29    7      7\nTreated              13    7     21\n\nvcd::mosaic(art, gp = shading_max)\n\n\n\n### Or\n### vcd::mosaic(structable(~ Treatment + Improved, data = Arthritis), gp = shading_max, split_vertical = TRUE)\n\nBalloon Plots\n\nhousetasks <- read.delim(\n  system.file(\"demo-data/housetasks.txt\", package = \"ggpubr\"),\n  row.names = 1\n  )\nhead(housetasks, 4)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nggballoonplot(housetasks, fill = \"value\")+\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"C\")\n\n\n\n\n\ndf <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)\nggballoonplot(df, x = \"Hair\", y = \"Eye\", size = \"Freq\",\n              fill = \"Freq\", facet.by = \"Sex\",\n              ggtheme = theme_bw()) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"C\")\n\n\n\n\nPlots for Likert Data\nIn many business situations, we perform surveys to get Likert Scale data, where several respondents rate a product or a service on a scale of Very much like, somewhat like, neutral, Dislike and Very much dislike, for example. Such data may look for example as follows:\n\ndata(efc)\nhead(efc, 20)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nefc is a German data set from a European study on family care of older people. Following a common protocol, data were collected from national samples of approximately 1,000 family carers (i.e. caregivers) per country and clustered into comparable subgroups to facilitate cross-national analysis. One of the research questions in this EUROFAM study was:\n\nWhat are the main difficulties carers experience accessing the services used? What prevents carers from accessing unused supports that they need? What causes them to stop using still-needed services?\n\nWe will select the variables from the efc data set that related to coping (on part of care-givers) and plot their responses after inspecting them:\n\nefc %>% select(dplyr::contains(\"cop\")) %>% str()\n\n'data.frame':   908 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ c82cop1: num  3 3 2 4 3 2 4 3 3 3 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"do you feel you cope well as caregiver?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"never\" \"sometimes\" \"often\" \"always\"\n $ c83cop2: num  2 3 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"do you find caregiving too demanding?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c84cop3: num  2 3 1 3 1 3 4 2 3 1 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"does caregiving cause difficulties in your relationship with your friends?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c85cop4: num  2 3 4 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"does caregiving have negative effect on your physical health?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c86cop5: num  1 4 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"does caregiving cause difficulties in your relationship with your family?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c87cop6: num  1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"does caregiving cause financial difficulties?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c88cop7: num  2 3 1 1 1 2 4 2 3 1 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"do you feel trapped in your role as caregiver?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"Never\" \"Sometimes\" \"Often\" \"Always\"\n $ c89cop8: num  3 2 4 2 4 1 1 3 1 1 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"do you feel supported by friends/neighbours?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"never\" \"sometimes\" \"often\" \"always\"\n $ c90cop9: num  3 2 3 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"do you feel caregiving worthwhile?\"\n  ..- attr(*, \"labels\")= Named num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:4] \"never\" \"sometimes\" \"often\" \"always\"\n\n\nThe coping related variables have responses on the Likert Scale (1,2,3,4) which correspond to (never, sometimes, often, always), and each variable also has a label defining each variable. We can plot this data using the plot_likert function from package sjPlot:\n\nefc %>% select(dplyr::contains(\"cop\")) %>% \n  sjPlot::plot_likert(title = \"Caregiver Survey from EUROFAM\")\n\n\n\n\nSo there we are with Categorical data ! There are a few other plots with this type of data, which are useful in very specialized circumstances. One example of this is the agreement plot which captures the agreement between two (sets) of evaluators, on ratings given on a shared ordinal scale to a set of items. An example from the field of medical diagnosis is the opinions of two specialists on a common set of patients."

    "text": "Histograms and Frequency Distributions\nHistograms are best to show the distribution of raw quantitative data,by displaying the number of values that fall within defined ranges, often called buckets or bins.\nAlthough histograms may look similar to column charts, the two are different. First, histograms show continuous data, and usually you can adjust the bucket ranges to explore frequency patterns. For example, you can shift histogram buckets from 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc. to 0-2, 2-4, etc. By contrast, column charts show categorical data, such as the number of apples, bananas, carrots, etc. Second, histograms do not usually show spaces between buckets because these are continuous values, while column charts show spaces to separate each category.\nLet us listen to the late great Hans Rosling from the Gapminder Project, which aims at telling stories of the world with data, to remove systemic biases about poverty, income and gender related issues.\n\nExamine the Data\nLet us look at the popular mpg dataset ( from R ) using mosaic::inspect().

    "text": "What is Correlation?\nOne of the basic Questions we would have of our data is: Does some variable depend upon another in some way? Does \\(y\\) depend upon \\(x\\)? A Correlation Test is designed to answer exactly this question.\nThe word correlation is used in everyday life to denote some form of association. We might say that we have noticed a correlation between rainy days and reduced sales at supermarkets. However, in statistical terms we use correlation to denote association between two quantitative variables. We also assume that the association is linear, that one variable increases or decreases a fixed amount for a unit increase or decrease in the other. The other technique that is often used in these circumstances is regression, which involves estimating the best straight line to summarise the association."

    "text": "Correlation coefficient\nThe degree of association is measured by a correlation coefficient, denoted by r. It is sometimes called Pearson’s correlation coefficient after its originator and is a measure of linear association. (If a curved line is needed to express the relationship, other and more complicated measures of the correlation must be used.)\nThe correlation coefficient is measured on a scale that varies from + 1 through 0 to – 1. Complete correlation between two variables is expressed by either + 1 or -1. When one variable increases as the other increases the correlation is positive; when one decreases as the other increases it is negative.\nIn formal terms, the correlation between two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\rho = E\\left[\\frac{(x - \\mu_{x}) * (y - \\mu_{y})}{(\\sigma_x)*(\\sigma_y)}\\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(E\\) is the expectation operator ( i.e taking mean ). Think of this as the average of the products of two scaled variables. (We can see \\((x-\\mu_x)/\\sigma_x\\) is a centering and scaling of the variable \\(x\\). It is called the z-score of x.)"

So there is an attractive, and similar-looking alternative, called a fan chart which we will explore here.\n(Base) R has a simple pie command that does the job.\n\npie.sales <- c(0.12, 0.3, 0.26, 0.16, 0.04, 0.12)\nlabels <- c(\"Blueberry\", \"Cherry\",\n    \"Apple\", \"Boston Cream\", \"Other\", \"Vanilla Cream\")\npie(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,col =  grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= \"Plasma\", n = 6)) # default colours\n\n\n\n\nThe fan plot displays numerical values as arcs of overlapping sectors. This allows for more effective comparison:\n\nplotrix::fan.plot(x = pie.sales, labels = labels,\n                  col = grDevices::hcl.colors(palette= \"Plasma\", n = 6),\n                  shrink = 0.03, # How much to shrink each successive sector\n                  label.radius = 1.15,\n                  main = \"Fan Plot of Ice Cream Flavours\",\n                  # ticks = 360, \n                  # if we want tick marks on the circumference\n                  \n                  max.span = pi)\n\n\n\n\nThe donut chart suffers from the same defects as the pie, so should be used with discretion. The donut chart is essentially a geom_rect from ggplot, plotted on a polar coordinate set of of axes:\n\n# Data\ndf <- data.frame(group = LETTERS[1:3],\n                 value = c(25, 20, 35))\n\ndf <-\n  df %>% dplyr::mutate(\n    fraction = value / sum(value), # percentages\n    ymax = cumsum(fraction), # cumulative percentages\n    ymin = lag(ymax, 1, default = 0),\n    # bottom edge of each\n    label = paste0(group, \"\\n value: \", value),\n    labelPosition = (ymax + ymin) / 2 # labels midway on arcs\n  )\n\ndf\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nggplot(df) + \n# `geom_rect()` requires aesthetics: xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 2, xmax = 4, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, fill = group),colour = \"black\") + \n  geom_label( x=3.5, aes(y=labelPosition, label= label), size=4) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\",direction = 1) + # Upto here will give us a pie chart\n\n# When switching to polar coords:\n# x maps to r\n# y maps to theta\n# so we create a \"hole\" in the radius, in in \nxlim(c(0,4)) + # try to play with the \"0\"\ntheme_void() +\ntheme(legend.position = \"none\")"

Unique series identifier (4 total)\n\nStore Numeric. Store ID.\n\nDept Numeric. Department ID.\n\nDate Date. Weekly timestamp.\n\nWeekly_Sales Numeric. Sales for the given department in the given store.\n\nIsHoliday Logical. Whether the week is a “special” holiday for the store.\n\nType Character. Type identifier of the store.\n\nSize Numeric. Store square-footage\n\nTemperature Numeric. Average temperature in the region.\n\nFuel_Price Numeric. Cost of fuel in the region.\n\nMarkDown1, MarkDown2, MarkDown3, MarkDown4, MarkDown5 Numeric. Anonymized data related to promotional markdowns that Walmart is running. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA.\n\nCPI Numeric. The consumer price index.\n\nUnemployment Numeric. The unemployment rate in the region.\n\n\nVery cool to know that mosaic::inspect() identifies date variables separately!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE:\nThis is still a tibble, with a time-oriented variable of course, but not yet a time-series object. The data frame has the YMD columns repeated for each Dept, giving us what is called “long” form data. To deal with this repetition, we will always need to split the Weekly_Sales by the Dept column before we plot or analyze.\n\n\nSince our sales are weekly, we will convert Date to yearweek format:\n\n#|label: walmart sales tsibble\nwalmart_time <- walmart_sales_weekly %>% \n  # mutate(Date = as.Date(Date)) %>% \n  as_tsibble(index = Date, # Time Variable\n             key = Dept)\n             \n  #  Identifies unique \"subject\" who are measures\n  #  All other variables such as Weekly_sales become \"measured variable\"\n  #  Each observation should be uniquely identified by index and key\n\nwalmart_time\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBasic Time Series Plots\nThe easiest way is to use autoplot from the feasts package. You may need to specify the actual measured variable, if there is more than one numerical column:\n\nautoplot(walmart_time,\n         .vars = Weekly_Sales)\n\n\n\n\ntimetk gives us interactive plots that may be more evocative than the static plot above. The basic plot function with timetk is plot_time_series. There are arguments for the date variable, the value you want to plot, colours, groupings etc.\nLet us explore this dataset using timetk, using our trusted method of asking Questions:\nQ.1 How are the weekly sales different for each Department?\nThere are 7 number of Departments. So we should be fine plotting them and also facetting with them, as we will see in a bit:\n\nwalmart_time %>% timetk::plot_time_series(.date_var = Date, \n                                            .value = Weekly_Sales,\n                   .color_var = Dept, \n                   .legend_show = TRUE,\n                   .title = \"Walmart Sales Data by Department\",\n                   .smooth = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.2. What do the sales per Dept look like during the month of December (Christmas time) in 2012? Show the individual Depts as facets.\nWe can of course zoom into the interactive plot above, but if we were to plot it anyway:\n\n# Only include rows from  1 to December 31, 2011\n# Data goes only up to Oct 2012\n\nwalmart_time %>% \n  # Each side of the time_formula is specified as the character 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS',\n  timetk::filter_by_time(.date_var = Date,\n                         .start_date = \"2011-12-01\",\n                         .end_date = \"2011-12-31\") %>%\n\n  plot_time_series(.date_var = Date, \n                   .value = Weekly_Sales, \n                   .color_var = Dept, \n                   .facet_vars = Dept, \n                   .facet_ncol = 2,\n                   .smooth = FALSE) # Only 4 points per graph\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly the “unfortunate” Dept#13 has seen something of a Christmas drop in sales, as has Dept#38 ! The rest, all is well, it seems…\nToo much noise? How about some averaging?\nQ.3 How do we smooth out some of the variations in the time series to be able to understand it better?\nSometimes there is too much noise in the time series observations and we want to take what is called a rolling average. For this we will use the function timetk::slidify to create an averaging function of our choice, and then apply it to the time series using regular dplyr::mutate\n\n# Let's take the average of Sales for each month in each Department.\n# Our **function** will be named \"rolling_avg_month\": \n\nrolling_avg_month = slidify(.period = 4, # every 4 weeks\n                            .f = mean, # The funtion to average\n                            .align = \"center\", # Aligned with middle of month\n                            .partial = TRUE) # TO catch any leftover half weeks\nrolling_avg_month\n\nfunction (...) \n{\n    slider_2(..., .slider_fun = slider::pslide, .f = .f, .period = .period, \n        .align = .align, .partial = .partial, .unlist = .unlist)\n}\n<bytecode: 0x0000021e4bee3958>\n<environment: 0x0000021e4bee03a0>\n\n\nOK, slidify creates a function! Let’s apply it to the Walmart Sales time series…\n\nwalmart_time %>% \n  # group_by(Dept) %>% \n  mutate(avg_monthly_sales = rolling_avg_month(Weekly_Sales)) %>% \n  # ungroup() %>% \n  timetk::plot_time_series(Date, avg_monthly_sales,.color_var = Dept, .smooth = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nCurves are smoother now. Need to check whether the averaging was done on a per-Dept basis…should we have had a group_by(Dept) before the averaging, and ungroup() before plotting? Try it !!\nDecomposing Time Series: Trends, Seasonal Patterns, and Cycles\nEach data point (\\(Y_t\\)) at time \\(t\\) in a Time Series can be expressed as either a sum or a product of 4 components, namely, Seasonality(\\(S_t\\)), Trend(\\(T_t\\)), Cyclic, and Error(\\(e_t\\)) (a.k.a White Noise).\n\nTrend: pattern exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.\nSeasonal: pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).\nCyclic: pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period (duration usually of at least 2 years). Often combined with Trend into “Trend-Cycle”.\nError or Noise: Random component\n\nDecomposing non-seasonal datas means breaking it up into trend and irregular components. To estimate the trend component of a non-seasonal time series that can be described using an additive model, it is common to use a smoothing method, such as calculating the simple moving average of the time series.\ntimetk has the ability to achieve this: Let us plot the trend, seasonal, cyclic and irregular aspects of Weekly_Sales for Dept 38:\n\nwalmart_time %>% \n  filter(Dept == \"38\") %>% \n  timetk::plot_stl_diagnostics(.data = .,\n                               .date_var = Date, \n                               .value = Weekly_Sales)\n\nfrequency = 13 observations per 1 quarter\n\n\ntrend = 52 observations per 1 year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this for all Dept using fable and fabletools:\n\nwalmart_decomposed <- \n  walmart_time %>% \n  \n  # If we want to filter, we do it here\n  filter(Dept == \"38\") %>% \n  # \n\nfabletools::model(stl = STL(Weekly_Sales))\n\nfabletools::components(walmart_decomposed)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nautoplot(components((walmart_decomposed)))"

Analysis of Time Series is commercially important because of industrial need and relevance, especially with respect to Forecasting (Weather data, sports scores, population growth figures, stock prices, demand, sales, supply…). For example, in the graph shown below are the temperatures over time in two US cities:\n\n\nWhat can we do with Time Series? A time series can be broken down to its components so as to systematically understand, analyze, model and forecast it. As with other datasets, we have to begin by answering fundamental questions, such as:\n\nWhat are the types of time series?\nHow do we visualize time series?\nHow do we decompose the time series into level,trend, and seasonal components?\nHoe might we make a model of the underlying process that creates these time series?\nHow do we make useful forecasts with the data we have?\n\nWe will first look at the multiple data formats for time series in R. Alongside we will look at the R packages that work with these formats and create graphs and measures using those objects. We will then look at obtaining the components of the time series and try our hand at modelling and forecasting."

    "text": "Time Series Data Formats\nThere are multiple formats for time series data. The ones that we are likely to encounter most are\n\ntibble format: the simplest is of course the standard tibble/ dataframe, with a time column/variable to indicate that the other variables vary with time. The standard tibble object is used by many packages, e.g. timetk & modeltime\nThe ts format: We may simply have a single series of measurements that are made over time, stored as a numerical vector. The stats::ts() function will convert a numeric vector into an R time series ts object, which is the most basic time series object in R. The base ts object is used by established packages forecast and is also supported by newer packages such as tsbox.\nThe modern tsibble format: this is a new modern format for time series analysis. The special tsibble object (“time series tibble”) is used by fable, feasts and others from the tidyverts set of packages.\n\nThere are other time-oriented data formats too…probably too many, such a tibbletime and TimeSeries objects. For now the best way to deal with these, should you encounter them, is to use tsbox to convert them to a tibble or tsibble and work with these."

    "text": "Creating and Plotting Time Series\nIn this first example, we will use simple ts data first, and then do another with tibble format that we can plot as is and then do more after conversion to tsibble format, and then a third example with a ground-up tsibble dataset.\n\nts format data\nThere are a few datasets in base R that are in ts format already.\n\nAirPassengers\n\n     Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n1949 112 118 132 129 121 135 148 148 136 119 104 118\n1950 115 126 141 135 125 149 170 170 158 133 114 140\n1951 145 150 178 163 172 178 199 199 184 162 146 166\n1952 171 180 193 181 183 218 230 242 209 191 172 194\n1953 196 196 236 235 229 243 264 272 237 211 180 201\n1954 204 188 235 227 234 264 302 293 259 229 203 229\n1955 242 233 267 269 270 315 364 347 312 274 237 278\n1956 284 277 317 313 318 374 413 405 355 306 271 306\n1957 315 301 356 348 355 422 465 467 404 347 305 336\n1958 340 318 362 348 363 435 491 505 404 359 310 337\n1959 360 342 406 396 420 472 548 559 463 407 362 405\n1960 417 391 419 461 472 535 622 606 508 461 390 432\n\nstr(AirPassengers)\n\n Time-Series [1:144] from 1949 to 1961: 112 118 132 129 121 135 148 148 136 119 ...\n\n\nThis can be easily plotted using base R and other more recent packages:\n\nplot(AirPassengers) # Base R\n\n\n\ntsbox::ts_plot(AirPassengers) # tsbox static plot\n\n\n\nTSstudio::ts_plot(AirPassengers) # TSstudio interactive plot\n\n\n\n\n\nOne can see that there is an upward trend and also seasonal variations that also increase over time.\nLet us take data that is “time oriented” but not in ts format. We use the command ts to convert a numeric vector to ts format: the syntax of ts() is:\nSyntax: objectName <- ts(data, start, end, frequency), where,\n\n\ndata : represents the data vector\n\nstart : represents the first observation in time series\n\nend : represents the last observation in time series\n\nfrequency : represents number of observations per unit time. For example 1=annual, 4=quarterly, 12=monthly, 7=weekly, etc.\n\nWe will pick simple numerical vector data ( i.e. not a time series ) ChickWeight:\n\nChickWeight %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Filter for Chick #1 and for Diet #1\nChickWeight_ts <- ChickWeight %>% \n  filter(Chick == 1, Diet ==1) %>% \n  select(weight, Time)\n\nChickWeight_ts <- stats::ts(ChickWeight_ts$weight, frequency = 2) \nChickWeight_ts\n\nTime Series:\nStart = c(1, 1) \nEnd = c(6, 2) \nFrequency = 2 \n [1]  42  51  59  64  76  93 106 125 149 171 199 205\n\n\n\nplot(ChickWeight_ts)\n\n\n\n#ts_boxable(ChickWeight_ts)\ntsbox::ts_plot(ChickWeight_ts,\n               ylab = \"Weight of Chick#1\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTSstudio::ts_plot(ts.obj = ChickWeight_ts,\n                  Xtitle = \"Time\", \n                  Ytitle = \"Weight of Chick #1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntibble data\nUsing the familiar tibble structure opens up new possibilities. We can have multiple time series within a tibble (think GDP, Population, Imports, Exports for multiple countries as with the gapminder data we saw earlier). It also allows for data processing with dplyr such as filtering and summarizing.\nLet us read and inspect in the US births data from 2000 to 2014. Download this data by clicking on the icon below, and saving the downloaded file in a sub-folder called data inside your project:\n\n\n\n Download US Births Data\n\n\n\nRead this data in:\n\nbirths_2000_2014 <- read_csv(\"data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv\")\nbirths_2000_2014\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ggformula\nUsing tsbox and TSstudio\n\n\n\nWe will now plot this using ggformula.\nWith the separate year/month/week and day_of_week / day_of_month columns, we can plot births over time, colouring by day_of_week, for example:\n\nbirths_2000_2014 %>% \n  \n# So that we can have discrete colours for each month\n  # mutate(month = as_factor(month)) %>% \n  # \n  # group_by(year, month) %>% \n  # summarise(mean_monthly_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  gf_line(births ~ year, group = ~ day_of_week, color = ~ day_of_week) %>% \n  gf_point() %>% \n  gf_theme(scale_colour_distiller(palette = \"Paired\")) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n\nNot particularly illuminating. This is because the data is daily and we have considerable variation over time.\nWe should calculate the the mean births on a month basis in each year and plot that:\n\nbirths_2000_2014 %>% \n         \n         # So that we can have discrete colours for each month\n         mutate(month = as_factor(month)) %>% \n  \n  group_by(year, month) %>% \n  summarise(mean_monthly_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  gf_line(mean_monthly_births ~ year, \n          group = ~ month, \n          colour = ~month) %>% \n  gf_point() %>% \n  gf_theme(scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n\nSo…average births per month were higher in 2005 to 2007 and have dropped since. We can do similar graphs using day_of_week as our basis for grouping, instead of month:\n\nbirths_2000_2014 %>% \n  mutate(\n         # So that we can have discrete colours for each week day\n         day_of_week = base::factor(day_of_week,\n                                    levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7), \n                                    labels = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"))) %>% \n  group_by(year, day_of_week) %>% \n  summarise(mean_weekly_births = mean(births, \n                                      na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  gf_line(mean_weekly_births ~ year, \n             group = ~ day_of_week, \n             colour = ~ day_of_week, data = .) %>% \n  gf_point() %>% \n  \n  # palette for 12 colours\n  gf_theme(scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")) %>% \n\n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n\nLooks like an interesting story here…there are significantly fewer births on average on Sat and Sun, over the years! Why? Should we watch Grey’s Anatomy ?\n\n\nSo far we are simply treating the year/month/day variables are simple numerical variables. We have not created an explicit time or date variable. Let us do that now:\nSo there are several numerical variables for year, month, and day_of_month, day_of_week, and of course the births on a daily basis. tsbox::ts_plot needs just the data and the births column to plot with and not be confused by the other numerical columns, so let us create a time column from these three, but retain them for now.\n\nbirths_timeseries <- \n  births_2000_2014 %>% \n  mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year,\n                                     month = month,\n                                     day = date_of_month)) %>% \n  select(date, births, year, month,date_of_month, day_of_week)\n\nbirths_timeseries\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nPlotting this directly:\n\nbirths_timeseries %>% \n  select(date, births) %>% \n  tsbox::ts_plot()\n\n[time]: 'date' [value]: 'births' \n\n\n\n\nbirths_timeseries %>% \n  select(date, births) %>% \n  TSstudio::ts_plot()\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we need setup average monthly and weekly births as before, we need to understand more of data processing with time series, similar to what dplyr does for tibble.\n\n\n\n\ntsibble data\nFinally, tsibble ( “time series tibble”) format data contains three main components:\n\nan index variable that defines time;\na set of key variables, usually categorical, that define sets of observations, over time. This allows for each combination of the categorical variables to define a separate time series.\na set of quantitative variables, that represent the quantities that vary over time ( i.e index)\n\nHere is Robert Hyndman’s video introducing tsibbles:\n\nThe package tsibbledata contains several ready made tsibble format data. Run data(package = \"tsibbledata\") in your Console to find out about these. Let us try PBS which is a dataset containing Monthly Medicare prescription data in Australia.\n\ndata(\"PBS\")\nPBS\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is a large dataset, with 67K observations, for 336 combinations of key variables (Concession, Type, ATC1, ATC2) which are categorical, as foreseen. Data appears to be monthly, as indicated by the 1M. Note that there are multiple Quantitative variables (Scripts,Cost), a feature which is not supported in the ts format, but is supported in a tsibble. The Qualitative Variables are described below. (Type help(\"PBS\") in your Console)\n\nThe data is dis-aggregated/grouped using four keys:\n\n\n\n\nConcession: Concessional scripts are given to pensioners, unemployed, dependents, and other card holders\n\nType: Co-payments are made until an individual’s script expenditure hits a threshold ($290.00 for concession, $1141.80 otherwise). Safety net subsidies are provided to individuals exceeding this amount.\n\nATC1: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical index (level 1). 15 types\n\nATC2: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical index (level 2). 84 types, nested inside ATC1\n\n\n\nLet us simply plot Cost over time:\n\nPBS %>% \n  gf_point(Cost ~ Month, data = .) %>% \n  gf_line() %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n\nThis basic plot is quite messy. We can use dplyr functions such as mutate(), filter(), select() and summarise() to work with tsibble objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntsibble package\n\n\n\nThere are specialized functions in the tsibble package to do with the index ( i.e time) variable similar things to what dplyr does.\n\n\nLet us first see how many observations there are for each combo of keys:\n\nPBS %>% \n  tsibble::group_by_key(ATC1, ATC2, Concession, Type) %>% \n  count()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe have 336 combinations of Qualitative variables, each containing 204 observations: so let us filter for a few such combinations and plot:\n\nPBS %>% dplyr::filter(Concession == \"General\", \n                      ATC1 == \"A\",\n                      ATC2 == \"A10\") %>% \n  gf_line(Cost ~ Month, \n          colour = ~ Type, \n          data = .) %>% \n  gf_point() %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, very different time patterns based on the two Types of payment methods. Strongly seasonal for both, with seasonal variation increasing over the years, but there is an upward trend with the Co-payments method of payment.\nFinally, it may be a good idea to convert some tibble into a tsibble to leverage some of functions that tsibble offers:\n\nbirths_tsibble <- births_2000_2014 %>% \n  mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year,\n                                     month = month,\n                                     day = date_of_month)) %>%\n  tsibble::as_tsibble(index = date) # Time Variable\n\nbirths_tsibble\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is DAILY data of course. Let us say we want to group by month and plot mean monthly births as before, but now using tsibble and the index variable:\n\n\nBasic Plot\nGrouped Plot version 1\nGrouped Plot version 2\nErrors\n\n\n\n\nbirths_tsibble %>%\n  gf_line(births ~ date, data = .) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\n# Very busy plot\n# Try to group by month and take average as before\n# this time with tsibble\n# \n\n\n\n\nbirths_tsibble %>% \n  tsibble::index_by(month_index = ~ yearmonth(.)) %>% \n  \n  # Monthly Birth Averages \n  summarise(mean_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  \n  gf_point(mean_births ~ month_index, data = .) %>% \n  gf_line() %>% \n  gf_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\") %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_minimal())\n\n\n\n\nApart from the bump during in 2006-2007, there are also seasonal trends that repeat each year, which we glimpsed earlier.\n\n\n\nbirths_tsibble %>% \n  tsibble::index_by(year_index = ~ year(.)) %>% \n\n  # Annual Birth Averages now\n  summarise(mean_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  \n  gf_point(mean_births ~ year_index, data = .) %>% \n  gf_line() %>% \n  gf_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\") %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_minimal())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#|label: Why not use dplyr group_by?\nbirths_tsibble %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(year) %>% \n# This grouping does not give a proper result\n# The grouping by `index` is different\n# Annual Birth Average as before\n  summarise(mean_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Should give 15 rows but does not!\n# The original dataset does, however."

    "text": "Seasons, Trends, Cycles, and Random Changes\nHere are how the different types of patterns in time series are as follows:\n\nTrend: A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a trend as “changing direction”, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.\n\n\nSeasonal: A seasonal pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. The monthly sales of drugs ( with the PBD data ) shows seasonality which is induced partly by the change in the cost of the drugs at the end of the calendar year.\n\n\nCyclic: A cycle occurs when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency. These fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions, and are often related to the “business cycle”. The duration of these fluctuations is usually at least 2 years.\n\nThe function feasts::STL allows us to create these decompositions\nLet us try to find and plot these patterns in Time Series.\n\nbirths_STL_yearly <- births_tsibble %>% \n  fabletools::model(STL(births ~ season(period = \"year\")))\n\nfabletools::components(births_STL_yearly)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nfeasts::autoplot(components(births_STL_yearly))\n\n\n\n\nHow about a heatmap? We can cook up a categorical variable based on the number of births (low, fine, high) and use that to create a heatmap:\n\nlibrary(ggformula)\n\nbirths_2000_2014 %>%  \n  mutate(birthrate = case_when(births >=10000 ~ \"high\", births <= 8000 ~ \"low\", TRUE ~ \"fine\")) %>% \n  gf_tile(data = ., year ~ month, fill = ~ birthrate, color = \"black\") %>%\n  \n  gf_theme(scale_x_time(breaks = 1:12, labels = c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\",\"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"))) %>% \n  \n  gf_theme(theme_classic())"

    "text": "The Big Ideas in Stats\nSteven Stigler is the author of the book “The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom”. The Big Ideas in Statistics from that book are:\n\n\nAggregation\n\nThe first pillar I will call Aggregation, although it could just as well be given the nineteenth-century name, “The Combination of Observations,” or even reduced to the simplest example, taking a mean. Those simple names are misleading, in that I refer to an idea that is now old but was truly revolutionary in an earlier day—and it still is so today, whenever it reaches into a new area of application. How is it revolutionary? By stipulating that, given a number of observations, you can actually gain information by throwing information away! In taking a simple arithmetic mean, we discard the individuality of the measures, subsuming them to one summary.\n\n\n\nInformation\n\nIn the early eighteenth century it was discovered that in many situations the amount of information in a set of data was only proportional to the square root of the number n of observations, not the number n itself.\n\n\n\nLikelihood\n\nBy the name I give to the third pillar, Likelihood, I mean the calibration of inferences with the use of probability. The simplest form for this is in significance testing and the common P-value, but as the name “Likelihood” hints, there is a wealth of associated methods, many related to parametric families or to Fisherian or Bayesian inference.\n\n\n\nIntercomparison\n\nIt represents what was also once a radical idea and is now commonplace: that statistical comparisons do not need to be made with respect to an exterior standard but can often be made in terms interior to the data themselves. The most commonly encountered examples of intercomparisons are Student’s t-tests and the tests of the analysis of variance.\n\n\n\nRegression\n\nI call the fifth pillar Regression, after Galton’s revelation of 1885, explained in terms of the bivariate normal distribution. Galton arrived at this by attempting to devise a mathematical framework for Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, overcoming what appeared to Galton to be an intrinsic contradiction in the theory: selection required increasing diversity, in contradiction to the appearance of the population stability needed for the definition of species.\n\n\n\nDesign of Experiments and Observations\n\nThe sixth pillar is Design, as in “Design of Experiments,” but conceived of more broadly, as an ideal that can discipline our thinking in even observational settings.Starting in the late nineteenth century, a new understanding of the topic appeared, as Charles S. Peirce and then Fisher discovered the extraordinary role randomization could play in inference.\n\n\n\nResiduals\n\nThe most common appearances in Statistics are our model diagnostics (plotting residuals), but more important is the way we explore high-dimensional spaces by fitting and comparing nested models.\n\n\n\nIn our work with Statistical Models, we will be working with all except Idea 6 above."

    "text": "What is a Statistical Model?\nFrom Daniel Kaplan’s book:\n“Modeling” is a process of asking questions. “Statistical” refers in part to data – the statistical models you will construct will be rooted in data. But it refers also to a distinctively modern idea: that you can measure what you don’t know and that doing so contributes to your understanding.\nThe conclusions you reach from data depend on the specific questions you ask.\nThe word “modeling” highlights that your goals, your beliefs, and your current state of knowledge all influence your analysis of data.\nSimilarly, in statistical modeling, you examine your data to see whether they are consistent with the hypotheses that frame your understanding of the system under study."

    "section": "Uses and Types of Statistical Models",
    "text": "Uses and Types of Statistical Models\nThere are three main uses for statistical models. They are closely related, but distinct enough to be worth enumerating.\n\nDescription. Sometimes you want to describe the range or typical values of a quantity. For example, what’s a “normal” white blood cell count? Sometimes you want to describe the relationship between things. Example: What’s the relationship between the price of gasoline and consumption by automobiles?\nClassification or prediction. You often have information about some observable traits, qualities, or attributes of a system you observe and want to draw conclusions about other things that you can’t directly observe. For instance, you know a patient’s white blood-cell count and other laboratory measurements and want to diagnose the patient’s illness.\nAnticipating the consequences of interventions. Here, you intend to do something: you are not merely an observer but an active participant in the system. For example, people involved in setting or debating public policy have to deal with questions like these: To what extent will increasing the tax on gasoline reduce consumption? To what extent will paying teachers more increase student performance?\n\nThe appropriate form of a model depends on the purpose. For example, a model that diagnoses a patient as ill based on an observation of a high number of white blood cells can be sensible and useful. But that same model could give absurd predictions about intervention: Do you really think that lowering the white blood cell count by bleeding a patient will make the patient better?\nTo anticipate correctly the effects of an intervention you need to get the direction of cause and effect correct in your models. But for a model used for classification or prediction, it may be unnecessary to represent causation correctly. Instead, other issues, e.g., the reliability of data, can be the most important. One of the thorniest issues in statistical modeling – with tremendous consequences for science, medicine, government, and commerce – is how you can legitimately draw conclusions about interventions from models based on data collected without performing these interventions.\nThe Intent of Modelling\nFrom Daniel T. Kaplan’s book:\n\nStatistics is about variation. Describing and interpreting variation is a major goal of statistics.\nYou can create empirical, mathematical descriptions not only of a single trait or variable but also of the relationships between two or more traits. (Empirical means based on measurements, data, observations.)\n\nModels let you split variation into components: “explained” versus “unexplained.” How to measure the size of these components and how to compare them to one another is a central aspect of statistical methodology. Indeed, this provides a definition of statistics:\n\nStatistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains unexplained.\n\n\nBy collecting data in ways that require care but are quite feasible, you can estimate how reliable your descriptions are, e.g., whether it’s plausible that you should see similar relationships if you collected new data. This notion of reliability is very narrow and there are some issues that depend critically on the context in which the data were collected and the correctness of assumptions that you make about how the world works.\nRelationships between pairs of traits can be studied in isolation only in special circumstances. In general, to get valid results it is necessary to study entire systems of traits simultaneously. Failure to do so can easily lead to conclusions that are grossly misleading.\nDescriptions of relationships are often subjective – they depend on choices that you, the modeler, make. These choices are generally rooted in your own beliefs about how the world works, or the theories accepted as plausible within some community of inquiry.\nIf data are collected properly, you can get an indication of whether the data are consistent or inconsistent with your subjective beliefs or – and this is important – whether you don’t have enough data to tell either way.\nModels can be used to check out the sensitivity of your conclusions to different beliefs. People who disagree in their views of how the world works often may not be able to reconcile their differences based on data, but they will be able to decide objectively whether their own or the other party’s beliefs are reasonable given the data.\nNotwithstanding everything said above about the strong link between your prior, subjective beliefs and the conclusions you draw from data, by collecting data in a certain context – experiments – you can dramatically simplify the interpretation of the results. It’s actually possible to remove the dependence on identified subjective beliefs by intervening in the system under study experimentally.\nTypes of Models\nLet us look at the famous dataset pertaining to Francis Galton’s work on the heights of children and the heights of their parents. We can create 4 kinds of models based on the types of variables in that dataset.\n\n\nVariables and Models\n\n\nOur method in this set of modules is to take the modern view that all these models can be viewed from a standpoint of the Linear Model, also called Linear Regression \\(y = \\beta_1 *x + \\beta_0\\) . For example, it is relatively straightforward to imagine Plot B (Quant vs Quant ) as an example of a Linear Model, with the dependent variable modelled as \\(y\\) and the independent one as \\(x\\). We will try to work up to the intuition that this model can be used to understand all the models in the Figure."

    "text": "Introduction\nSuppose we have three sales strategies on our website, to sell a certain product, say men’s shirts. We have website interaction over several months. How do we know which strategy makes people buy the fastest ?\nIf there is a University course that is offered in parallel in three different classrooms, is there a difference between the average marks obtained by students in each of the classrooms?\nIn each case we have a set of observations in each category: Interaction Time vs Sales Strategy in the first example, and Student Marks vs Classroom in the second. We can take mean scores in each category and decide to compare them. How do we make the comparisons? One way would be to compare them pair-wise. But with this rapidly becomes intractable and also dangerous: with increasing number of groups, the number of mean-comparisons becomes very large \\(N\\choose 2\\) and with each comparison the possibility of some difference showing up, just by chance, increases! And we end up making the wrong inference and perhaps the wrong decision.\nThe trick is of course to make comparisons all at once and ANOVA is the technique that allows us to do just that. In this tutorial, we will compare the Hatching Time of frog spawn1, at three different lab temperatures. Our research question is:1 The ANOVA tutorial at Our Coding Club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question\n\n\n\nHow does frogspawn hatching time vary with temperature?\n\n\nRead the Data\nDownload the data by clicking the button below:\n Download the frogs data \n\nShow the Codefrogs_orig <- read_csv(\"data/frogs.csv\")\n\nRows: 60 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (4): Frogspawn sample id, Temperature13, Temperature18, Temperature25\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nShow the Codefrogs_orig\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOur response variable is the hatching Time. Our explanatory variable is a factor, Temperature, with 3 levels: 13°C, 18°C and 25°C. Different samples of spawn were subject to each of these temperatures respectively. The data is badly organized, with a separate column for each Temperature, with NA entries since not all samples of spawn could be subject to all temperatures. Hence, we should pivot_longer() this data, so all Time readings are in one column, and also convert the Temperature into a factor:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_long <- frogs_orig %>% \n  pivot_longer(., cols = starts_with(\"Temperature\"),\n               cols_vary = \"fastest\", # new in pivot_longer\n               names_to = \"Temp\",\n               values_to = \"Time\") %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  \n  # knock off the unnecessary \"Temperature\" word everywhere\n  separate_wider_regex(cols = Temp,\n                       patterns = c(\"Temperature\", \n                                     TempFac = \"\\\\d+\"), \n                       cols_remove = TRUE) %>% \n  \n  # Convert Temp into TempFac, a 3-level factor\n  mutate(TempFac = factor(x = TempFac,\n                              levels = c(13,18,25), \n                              labels = c(\"13\", \"18\", \"25\"))) %>% \n  rename(\"Id\" = `Frogspawn sample id`)\n\nfrogs_long\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nShow the Codefrogs_long %>% count(TempFac)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSo we have 20 samples for Hatching Time per TempFac setting."

    "text": "ANOVA\nWe will first execute the ANOVA test with code and evaluate the results. Then we will do an intuitive walk through of the process and finally, hand-calculate entire analysis for clear understanding.\n\n\nANOVA Test with Code\nANOVA Intuitive\nANOVA Manually Demonstrated (Apologies to Spinoza)\n\n\n\nR offers a very simple command to execute an ANOVA test: Note the familiar formula of stating the variables:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_anova <- aov(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)\nfrogs_anova %>% broom::tidy()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Codesummary(frogs_anova)\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    \nTempFac      2 1020.9   510.5   385.9 <2e-16 ***\nResiduals   57   75.4     1.3                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe effect of Temperature on Hatching time is significant, with a p-value of \\(<2e-16\\). The F-statistic for the ANOVA test is given by \\(385.9\\), which is very high.\nClearly Temperature has a very significant effect on the hatching Time.\nTo find which specific value of TempFac has the most effect will require pairwise comparison of the group means, using a standard t-test. The confidence level for such repeated comparisons will need what is called Bonferroni correction2 to prevent us from detecting a significant (pair-wise) difference simply by chance. To do this we take \\(\\alpha\\) the confidence level used and divide it by \\(K\\), the number of pair-wise comparisons we intend to make. So using an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) for ANOVA, the pairwise comparisons in our current data will have to use \\(\\alpha/3 = 0.0166\\) as the confidence level. We will discuss this more in the section titled “ANOVA Intuitive”.2 https://www.openintro.org/go/?id=anova-supplement&referrer=/book/ahss/index.php\n\n\nAll that is very well, but what is happening under the hood of the aov() command?\nConsider a data set with a single Quant and a single Qual variable. The Qual variable has two levels, the Quant data has 20 observations per Qual level.\n\nShow the Codelibrary(patchwork)\nggplot2::theme_set(theme_classic())\ndata = tibble(index = 1:40,\n              qual = c(rep(x = \"A\", 20),rep(x = \"B\", 20)),\n              quant = c(rnorm(n = 20, mean = 0, sd = 2), \n                        rnorm(n = 20, mean = 10, sd = 2)))\ndata\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Codeoverall_mean <- data %>%\n             summarise(overall_mean = mean(quant))\n#overall_mean\n\ngrouped_means <- data %>%\n  group_by(qual) %>% \n             summarise(grouped_means = mean(quant))\n#grouped_means\n\np1 <- gf_point(quant ~ index, \n               color = ~ qual,\n         data = data) %>% \n  gf_hline(yintercept =  ~ overall_mean,\n             data = overall_mean) %>% \n  gf_segment(data = data, \n             color = \"black\",\n             overall_mean$overall_mean + quant ~ index + index)\n\np2 <- gf_point(quant ~ index, \n         group = ~ qual, \n         colour = ~ qual, \n         data = data) %>% \n  \n  gf_hline(yintercept = ~ mean, \n           colour = ~ qual,\n           data = data %>% \n             group_by(qual) %>% \n             summarise(mean = mean(quant))) %>% \n  gf_segment(data = data %>% filter(qual == \"A\"),\n             grouped_means$grouped_means[1] + quant ~ index + index\n             ) %>% \n    gf_segment(data = data %>% filter(qual == \"B\"),\n             grouped_means$grouped_means[2] + quant ~ index + index\n             ) \n\np1 + p2 + patchwork::plot_annotation(tag_levels = c(\"A\", \"B\"))\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig A, the horizontal black line is the overall mean of quant, denoted as \\(\\mu_{tot}\\). The vertical black lines to the points show the departures of each point from this overall mean. The sum of squares of these vertical black lines in Fig A is called the Total Sum of Squares (SST).\n\\[\nSST = \\Sigma (y - \\mu_{tot})^2\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIf there are \\(k\\) levels in qual and \\(n\\) observations \\(y_ n\\) for each level, we can also write:\n\\[\nSST =\n\\sum_{i=1}^{kn}y_i^2 - \\frac{ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{kn}\ny_i \\right)^2}{kn}\n\\]\nIn Fig B, the horizontal green and red lines are the means of the individual groups, respectively \\(\\mu_A\\) and \\(\\mu_B\\). The green and red vertical lines are the departures, or errors, of each point from its own group-mean. The sum of the squares of the green and red lines is called the Total Error Sum of Squares (SSE).\n\\[\nSSE = \\Sigma [(y - \\mu_i)^2 +... (y - \\mu_k)^2]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf the \\(\\mu_A\\) and \\(\\mu_B\\) are different from \\(\\mu_{tot}\\), then what would be the relationship between \\(SSA\\) and \\(SSE\\)? Clearly if the all means are identical then the \\(SST\\) and \\(SSE\\) are equal, since the two coloured lines would be in the same place as the black line. It should be clear that if \\(\\mu_A\\) and \\(\\mu_B\\) are different from the overall mean, then \\(SSE < SST\\).\nSo, when we desire to detect if the two groups are different in their means, we take the difference:\n\\[\nSSA = SST - SSE\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\(SSA\\) is called the Treatment Sum of Squares and is a measure the differences in means of observations at different levels of the factor.\n\\(SSA\\) can also directly be re-written in a very symmetric fashion to Equation 1 as:\n\\[\nSSA = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{ij}\\right)^2 }{n} - \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{kn}y_i \\right)^2}{kn}\n\\]\nNote that in the first term, we are calculating sums of observations within each group in the inner summation, which is like a per-group mean(without the division), and squaring these (square means). The outer summation takes the sum of square-means of these undivided summations and divides by \\(n\\), giving us an average squared mean! Whew!\nComparing \\(SSA\\) and \\(SSE\\) now provides us with a method that helps us decide whether these means are different. The comparison is of course in the form of a ratio, the F-statistic.\nSince each of these measures uses a different sets of observations, the comparison is done after scaling each of \\(SSA\\) and \\(SSE\\) by the number of observations influencing them. This means that we need to divide each of \\(SSA\\) and \\(SSE\\) by their degrees of freedom, which gives us a ratio of variances:\n\\[\nF_{stat} = \\frac{SSA / df_{SSA}}{SSE / df_{SSE}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(df_{SSA}\\) and \\(df_{SSE}\\) are respectively the degrees of freedom in \\(SSA\\) and \\(SSE\\). And so we are in effect deciding if means are significantly different by analyzing (a ratio of) variances! Hence AN-alysis O-f VA-riance, ANOVA.\nIn order to find which of the means is significantly different from others, we need to make a pair-wise comparison of the means, applying the Bonferroni correction as stated before.\n\n\nLet us also hand-calculate the numbers so we know what the ANOVA test is doing.\nHere is the SST:\n\nShow the Code# Calculate overall sum squares SST\n\nfrogs_overall <- frogs_long %>% \n  summarise(mean_time = mean(Time), \n            # Overall mean across all readings\n            # The Black Line\n            \n            SST = sum((Time - mean_time)^2),\n            \n            # always use n = n() at the end of a summarise!!\n            n = n())\nfrogs_overall\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the CodeSST <- frogs_overall$SST\nSST\n\n[1] 1096.333\n\n\nAnd here is our plot to understand the SST:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_plot <- frogs_long %>% \n  arrange(TempFac) %>% \n           rowid_to_column(var = \"index\")\n\nfrogs_mean <- frogs_long %>%\n             summarise(overall_mean = mean(Time))\n\nfrogs_grouped_means <- frogs_long %>%\n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n             summarise(grouped_means = mean(Time))\n\ngf_point(Time ~ index, \n         color = ~ TempFac,\n         data = frogs_plot) %>% \n  \n gf_hline(yintercept =  ~ overall_mean,\n             data = frogs_mean) %>% \n  \n  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot, \n             color = \"black\",\n             frogs_mean$overall_mean + Time ~ index + index) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_frogs)\n\n\n\n\nHere is the SSE:\n\nShow the Code# First calculate sums of square errors *within* each group\n# with respect to individual group means\n# Then sum them together\n# Be careful of unbalanced groups!\n# Not all groups may have the same number of observations\n\nfrogs_within_groups <- frogs_long %>% \n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n   summarise(mean_time = mean(Time),\n            group_error_squares = sum((Time - mean_time)^2),\n            n = n())\nfrogs_within_groups\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Codefrogs_SSE <- frogs_within_groups %>% \n  summarise(SSE = sum(group_error_squares))\n\nSSE <- frogs_SSE$SSE\nSSE\n\n[1] 75.4\n\n\nWhat does the SSE look like in a graph?\n\nShow the Codefrogs_plot <- frogs_long %>% \n  arrange(TempFac) %>% \n           rowid_to_column(var = \"index\")\n\nfrogs_mean <- frogs_long %>%\n             summarise(overall_mean = mean(Time))\n\nfrogs_grouped_means <- frogs_long %>%\n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n             summarise(grouped_means = mean(Time))\n\ngf_point(Time ~ index, \n         group = ~ TempFac, \n         colour = ~ TempFac, \n         data = frogs_plot) %>% \n  \n  gf_hline(yintercept = ~ grouped_means, \n           colour = ~ TempFac,\n           data = frogs_grouped_means) %>% \n  \n  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 13 ),\n             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[1] + Time ~ index + index\n             ) %>% \n  \n  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 18),\n             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[2] + Time ~ index + index\n             ) %>% \n  \n  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 25),\n             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[3] + Time ~ index + index\n             ) %>% \n  \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_frogs)\n\n\n\n\nOK, we have \\(SST\\) and \\(SSE\\), so let’s get \\(SSA\\):\n\nShow the CodeSST\n\n[1] 1096.333\n\nShow the CodeSSE\n\n[1] 75.4\n\nShow the CodeSSA <- SST - SSE\nSSA\n\n[1] 1020.933\n\n\nWe have \\(SST = 1096\\), \\(SSE = 75.4\\) and therefore \\(SSA = 1020.9\\).\nIn order to calculate the F-Statistic, we need to compute the variances, using these sum of squares. We obtain variances from these Sums of Squares by dividing by their Degrees of Freedom:\n\\[\nF_{stat} = \\frac{SSA / df_{SSA}}{SSE / df_{SSE}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(df_{SSA}\\) and \\(df_{SSE}\\) are respectively the degrees of freedom in SSA and SSE.\nLet us calculate these Degrees of Freedom. With \\(k = 3\\) levels in the factor TempFac, and \\(n = 20\\) points per level, \\(SST\\) clearly has degree of freedom \\(kn-1 = 59\\), since it uses all observations but loses one degree to calculate the global mean. (If each level did not have the same number of points \\(n\\), we simply take all observations less one as the degrees of freedom for \\(SST\\)).\n\\(SSE\\) has \\(k*(n-1)\\) as degrees of freedom, since each of the \\(k\\) groups there are \\(n\\) observations and each group loses one degree to calculate its own group mean.\nAnd therefore, \\(SSA\\) being their difference, has \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom.\nWe can still calculate these in R, for the sake of method and clarity:\n\nShow the Code# Error Sum of Squares SSE\ndf_SSE <- frogs_long %>% \n  \n# Takes into account \"unbalanced\" situations\n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n  summarise(per_group_df_SSE = n() - 1) %>% \n  summarise(df_SSE = sum(per_group_df_SSE)) %>% \n  \n# Convert df_SSE from tibble to a scalar\n  as.integer()\n\n\n## Overall Sum of Squares SST\ndf_SST <- frogs_long %>% \n  summarise(df_SST = n() - 1) %>% \n  as.integer()\n\n\n# Treatment Sum of Squares SSA\nk <- length(unique(frogs_long$TempFac))\ndf_SSA <- k - 1\n\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the quantities are:\n\nShow the Codedf_SST\n\n[1] 59\n\nShow the Codedf_SSE\n\n[1] 57\n\nShow the Codedf_SSA\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNow we are ready to compute the F-statistic:\n\nShow the Code# Finally F_Stat!\n## Combine the sum-square_error for each level of the factor\n# weighted by degrees of freedom per level\n# Which are of course equal here ;-D\n\nMSE <- frogs_within_groups %>% \n  summarise(mean_square_error = sum(group_error_squares/df_SSE)) %>% \n  as.numeric()\nMSE\n\n[1] 1.322807\n\nShow the CodeMSA <- SSA/df_SSA # This is OK\nMSA\n\n[1] 510.4667\n\nShow the CodeF_stat <- MSA/MSE\nF_stat\n\n[1] 385.8966\n\n\nThe F-stat is compared with a critical value of the F-statistic, which is computes using the formula for the f-distribution in R. As with our hypothesis tests, we set the significance level to 0.95, and quote the two relevant degrees of freedom as parameters to qf() which computes the critical F value as a quartile:\n\nShow the CodeF_crit <-  qf(p = 0.95,     # Significance level is 5%\n              df1 = df_SSA, # Numerator degrees of freedom \n              df2 = df_SSE) # Denominator degrees of freedom\nF_crit\n\n[1] 3.158843\n\nShow the CodeF_stat\n\n[1] 385.8966\n\n\nThe F_crit value can also be seen in a plot3:3 https://rpubs.com/kerkhoffa/ANOVAbasic\n\nShow the Codemosaic::pdist(dist = \"f\",\n              q = 3.158843, \n              df1=df_SSA, df2=df_SSE)\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.95\n\n\nAny value of F more than the F_crit occurs with smaller probability than 0,05. Our F_stat is much higher than F_crit, by orders of magnitude! And so we can say with confidence that Temperature has a significant effect on spawn Time.\nAnd that is how ANOVA computes!"

Clearly however, the overall data cannot be normally distributed,especially if there is a strong effect of the TempFac factor! We therefore need to look for normality at each level of the factor:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_grouped <- frogs_long %>% \n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n  nest(.key = \"list\") \n\nfrogs_grouped %>% \n  pluck(\"list\", 1) %>% # naming the nested column \"list\"\n  select(Time) %>% \n  as_vector() %>% \n  shapiro.test(.)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.88954, p-value = 0.02638\n\nShow the Code# OK now we are set for group-wise Shapiro-Wilk testing:\n\nfrogs_grouped %>% \n  mutate(shaptest = \n           purrr::map(.x = list, # Column name is \"list\"\n                      .f = \\(.x) select(.data = .x, \n                                        Time) %>% \n                                 as_vector() %>% \n                                 shapiro.test(.)),\n         \n         params = map(.x = shaptest,\n                      .f = \\(.x) broom::tidy(.x))) %>% \n  \n  select(TempFac, params) %>% \n  unnest(cols = params)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe shapiro.wilk test makes a NULL Hypothesis that the data are normally distributed and estimates the probability that this could have happened by chance. Except for TempFac = 18 the p-values are less than 0.05 and we can reject the NULL hypothesis that each of these is normally distributed. Perhaps this is a sign that we need more than 20 samples per factor level.\nWe can also check the residuals post-model:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_anova$residuals %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  gf_histogram(~ value,data = .) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_frogs())\n\n\n\nShow the Codefrogs_anova$residuals %>%\n  as_tibble() %>% \n  gf_qq(~ value, data = .) %>% \n  gf_qqstep() %>% \n  gf_qqline() %>% \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_frogs())\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: sample\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\nShow the Codeshapiro.test(frogs_anova$residuals)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  frogs_anova$residuals\nW = 0.94814, p-value = 0.01275\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the residuals are also not normally distributed either.\nCheck for Similar Variance\nResponse data with different variances at different levels of an explanatory variable are said to exhibit heteroscedasticity. This violates one of the assumptions of ANOVA.\nTo check if the Time readings are similar in variance across levels of TempFac, we can use the Levene Test, or since our per-group observations are not normally distributed, a non-parametric rank-based Fligner-Killeen test. The NULL hypothesis is that the data are with similar variances. The tests assess how probable this is with the given data assuming this NULL hypothesis:\n\nShow the Codefrogs_long %>% \n  group_by(TempFac) %>% \n  summarise(variance = var(Time))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Code# Not too different...OK on with the test\nfligner.test(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)\n\n\n    Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  Time by TempFac\nFligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 0.53898, df = 2, p-value = 0.7638\n\nShow the CodeDescTools::LeveneTest(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt seems that there is no cause for concern here; the p-value is quite high and therefore we do not reject the NULL hypothesis that the data have similar variances.\nIndependent Observations\nThis is an experiment design concern; the way the data is gathered must be specified such that data for each level of the factors ( factor combinations if there are more than one) should be independent."

From the normality tests conducted earlier we see that except at one level of TempFac, the times are are not normally distributed. Hence we opt for a Permutation Test to check for significance of effect.\nAs remarked in Ernst4, the non-parametric permutation test can be both exact and also intuitively easier for students to grasp. Permutations are easily executed in R, using packages such as mosaic5.4 Ernst, Michael D. 2004. “Permutation Methods: A Basis for Exact Inference.” Statistical Science 19 (4): 676–85. doi:10.1214/088342304000000396.5 Pruim R, Kaplan DT, Horton NJ (2017). “The mosaic Package: Helping Students to ‘Think with Data’ Using R.” The R Journal, 9(1), 77–102. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024/index.html.\nWe proceed with a Permutation Test for TempFac. We shuffle the levels (13, 18, 25) randomly between the Times and repeat the ANOVA test each time and calculate the F-statistic. The Null distribution is the distribution of the F-statistic over the many permutations and the p-value is given by the proportion of times the F-statistic equals or exceeds that observed.\nWe will use mosaic and also try with infer.\n\n\nUsing mosaic\nUsing infer\n\n\n\n\nShow the Codeobs_F_stat <- frogs_anova %>% \n  broom::tidy() %>% \n  select(statistic)\nobserved_mosaic <- obs_F_stat$statistic[1]\n\nnull_dist_mosaic <- do(10000) * aov(Time ~ shuffle(TempFac), data = frogs_long)\nnull_dist_mosaic %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Codenull_dist_mosaic %>% drop_na() %>% \n  select(F) %>% \n  gf_histogram(data = ., ~ F, \n               fill = ~ F >= observed_mosaic,\n               title = \"Null Distribution of ANOVA F-statistic\" )\n\n\n\n\nThe Null distribution of the F_statistic under permutation shows it never crosses the real-world observed value, testifying the strength of the effect of TempFac on hatching Time. And the p-value is:\n\nShow the Codep_value <- mean(null_dist_mosaic$F >= observed_mosaic, na.rm = TRUE)\np_value\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the observed F-stat with infer:\n\nShow the Codeobserved_infer <- frogs_long %>% \n  specify(Time ~ TempFac) %>% \n  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\nobserved_infer\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe see that the observed F-Statistic is of course \\(385.8966\\) as before. Now we use infer to generate a NULL distribution using permutation of the factor TempFac:\n\nShow the Codenull_dist_infer <- frogs_long %>% \n  specify(Time ~ TempFac) %>% \n  hypothesise(null = \"independence\") %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"F\")\n\nhead(null_dist_infer)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nShow the Codenull_dist_infer %>% \n  visualise()\n\n\n\n\nAs seen, the infer based permutation test also shows that the permutationally generated F-statistics are nowhere near that which was observed. The effect of TempFac is very strong."

So each variable in the dataset is a population for that particular quantity/category, with appropriate population parameters such as means, sd-s, and proportions.\n\n\nLet us calculate the population parameters for the Height data:\n\npop_mean_height <- mean(~ Height, data = NHANES_adult)\npop_sd_height <- sd(~ Height, data = NHANES_adult)\n\npop_mean_height\n\n[1] 168.3497\n\npop_sd_height\n\n[1] 10.15705\n\n\nNow, we will sample ONCE from the NHANES Height variable. Let us take a sample of sample size 50. We will compare sample statistics with population parameters on the basis of this ONE sample of 50:\n\nsample_height <- sample(NHANES_adult, size = 50) %>% \n  select(Height)\nsample_height\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Sample Mean and Population Mean\n\nsample_mean_height <- mean(~ Height, data = sample_height)\nsample_mean_height\n\n[1] 165.866\n\n# Plotting the histogram of this sample\nsample_height %>% \n  gf_histogram(~ Height) %>% \n  \n  gf_vline(xintercept = sample_mean_height, \n           color = \"red\") %>% \n  \n  gf_vline(xintercept = pop_mean_height, \n           colour = \"blue\") %>% \n  \n  gf_text(1 ~ (pop_mean_height + 5), \n          label = \"Population Mean Height\", \n          color = \"blue\") %>% \n  \n  gf_text(2 ~ (sample_mean_height-5), \n          label = \"Sample Mean Height\", color = \"red\")  %>% \n  \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_minimal)\n\n\n\nSingle-Sample Mean and Population Mean\n\n\n\n\nOK, so the sample_mean_height is not too far from the pop_mean_height. Is this always true? Let us check: we will create 500 samples each of size 50. And calculate their mean as the sample statistic, giving us a dataframe containing 5000 sample means. We will then compare if these 500 means are close to the pop_mean_height:\n\nsample_height_500 <- do(500) * {\n  sample(NHANES_adult, size = 50) %>%\n    select(Height) %>%\n    summarise(\n      sample_mean_500 = mean(Height),\n      sample_min_500 = min(Height),\n      sample_max_500 = max(Height))\n}\n\nhead(sample_height_500)\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Sample-Means and Population Mean\n\ndim(sample_height_500)\n\n[1] 500   5\n\nsample_height_500 %>%\n  gf_point(.index ~ sample_mean_500, color = \"red\") %>%\n  \n  gf_segment(\n    .index + .index ~ sample_min_500 + sample_max_500,\n    color = \"red\",\n    size = 0.3,\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    ylab = \"Sample Index (1-500)\",\n    xlab = \"Sample Means\"\n  ) %>%\n  \n  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ pop_mean_height, \n           color = \"blue\") %>%\n  \n  gf_label(-15 ~ pop_mean_height, label = \"Population Mean\", \n           color = \"blue\") %>% \n  \n  gf_theme(theme = theme_minimal)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Sample-Means and Population Mean\n\n\n\n\nThe sample_means (red dots), are themselves random because the samples are random, of course. It appears that they are generally in the vicinity of the pop_mean (blue line).\nDistribution of Sample-Means\nSince the sample-means are themselves random variables, let’s plot the distribution of these 5000 sample-means themselves, called a a distribution of sample-means.\n\nNOTE: this a distribution of sample-means will itself have a mean and standard deviation. Do not get confused ;-D\n\nWe will also plot the position of the population mean pop_mean_height parameter, the means of the Height variable.\n\nsample_height_500 %>% \n  gf_dhistogram(~ sample_mean_500) %>% \n  \n  gf_vline(xintercept = pop_mean_height, \n           color = \"blue\") %>% \n  \n   gf_label(0.01 ~ pop_mean_height, \n            label = \"Population Mean\", \n            color = \"blue\")\n\nWarning: `stat(density)` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n\n\nSampling Mean Distribution\n\n\n\n\nHow does this distribution of sample-means compare with that of the overall distribution of the population?\n\nsample_height_500 %>% \n  gf_dhistogram(~ sample_mean_500) %>% \n  \n  gf_vline(xintercept = pop_mean_height, \n           color = \"blue\") %>% \n  \n   gf_label(0.01 ~ pop_mean_height, \n            label = \"Population Mean\", \n            color = \"blue\") %>% \n\n  ## Add the population histogram\n  gf_histogram(~ Height, data = NHANES_adult, \n               alpha = 0.2, fill = \"blue\", \n               bins = 50) %>% \n  \n  gf_label(0.025 ~ (pop_mean_height + 20), \n           label = \"Population Distribution\", color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\nSampling Means and Population Distributions\n\n\n\n\nCentral limit theorem\nWe see in the Figure above that\n\nthe distribution of sample-means is centered around mean = pop_mean.\nThat the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is less than that of the original population. But exactly what is it?\nAnd what is the kind of distribution?\n\nOne more experiment.\nNow let’s repeatedly sample Height and compute the sample mean, and look at the resulting histograms and Q-Q plots. ( Q-Q plots check whether a certain distribution is close to being normal or not.)\nWe will use sample sizes of c(16, 32, 64, 128) and generate 1000 samples each time, take the means and plot these 1000 means:\n\nset.seed(12345)\n\n\nsamples_height_16 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 16))\n\nsamples_height_32 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 32))\n\nsamples_height_64 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 64))\n\nsamples_height_128 <- do(1000) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 128))\n\n# Quick Check\nhead(samples_height_16)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n### do(1000,) * mean(resample(NHANES_adult$Height, size = 16)) produces a data frame with a variable named mean.\n###\n\nNow let’s create separate Q-Q plots for the different sample sizes.\n\n# Now let's create separate Q-Q plots for the different sample sizes.\n#\np1 <- gf_qq( ~ mean,data = samples_height_16,\n             title = \"N = 16\", \n             color = \"cornsilk\") %>%\n  gf_qqline()\n\np2 <- gf_qq( ~ mean,data = samples_height_32,\n            title = \"N = 32\", \n            color = \"sienna\") %>%\n  gf_qqline()\n\np3 <- gf_qq( ~ mean,data = samples_height_32,\n            title = \"N = 64\", \n            color = \"tomato2\") %>%\n  gf_qqline()\n\np4 <- gf_qq( ~ mean,data = samples_height_128,\n            title = \"N = 128\", \n            color = \"violetred\") %>%\n  gf_qqline()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4)\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: sample\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\nThe following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: sample\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\nThe following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: sample\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\nThe following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: sample\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us plot their individual histograms to compare them:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if we overlay the histograms:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows that the results become more normally distributed (i.e. following the straight line) as the samples get larger. Hence we learn that:\n\nthe sample-means are normally distributed around the population mean. This is because when we sample from the population, many values will be close to the population mean, and values far away from the mean will be increasingly scarce.\n\n\nmean(~ mean, data  = samples_height_16)\n\n[1] 168.306\n\nmean(~ mean, data  = samples_height_32)\n\n[1] 168.4349\n\nmean(~ mean, data  = samples_height_64)\n\n[1] 168.3184\n\nmean(~ mean, data  = samples_height_128)\n\n[1] 168.366\n\npop_mean_height\n\n[1] 168.3497\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\n\nThis is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n\nthe sample-means become “more normally distributed” with sample length, as shown by the (small but definite) improvements in the Q-Q plots with sample-size.\nthe sample-mean distributions narrow with sample length.\nThis is regardless of the distribution of the population itself.\n\n\n\nThe Height variable seems to be normally distributed at population level. We will try other non-normal population variables as an exercise).\nAs we saw above, the standard deviations of the sample-mean distributions reduce with sample size. In fact their SDs are defined by:\nsd = pop_sd/sqrt(sample_size) where sample-size here is one of c(16,32,64,128)\n\nsd(~ mean, data  = samples_height_16)\n\n[1] 2.578355\n\nsd(~ mean, data  = samples_height_32)\n\n[1] 1.834979\n\nsd(~ mean, data  = samples_height_64)\n\n[1] 1.280014\n\nsd(~ mean, data  = samples_height_128)\n\n[1] 0.9096318\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the sample-mean distribution is called the Standard Error. This statistic derived from the sample, will help us infer our population parameters with a precise estimate of the uncertainty involved.\n\\[\nStandard\\ Error\\ \\pmb {se} = \\frac{population\\ sd}{\\sqrt[]{sample\\ size}} \\\\\\\n\\pmb {se} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt[]{n}}\n\\]\nIn our sampling experiments, the Standard Errors evaluate to:\n\npop_sd_height <- sd(~ Height, data = NHANES_adult)\n\npop_sd_height/sqrt(16)\n\n[1] 2.539262\n\npop_sd_height/sqrt(32)\n\n[1] 1.795529\n\npop_sd_height/sqrt(64)\n\n[1] 1.269631\n\npop_sd_height/sqrt(128)\n\n[1] 0.8977646\n\n\nAs seen, these are identical to the Standard Deviations of the individual sample-mean distributions."

    "text": "Introduction: The Lady who Drank Tea\n\nThere is a famous story about a lady who claimed that tea with milk tasted different depending on whether the milk was added to the tea or the tea added to the milk. The story is famous because of the setting in which she made this claim. She was attending a party in Cambridge, England, in the 1920s. Also in attendance were a number of university dons and their wives. The scientists in attendance scoffed at the woman and her claim. What, after all, could be the difference?\nAll the scientists but one, that is. Rather than simply dismiss the woman’s claim, he proposed that they decide how one should test the claim. The tenor of the conversation changed at this suggestion, and the scientists began to discuss how the claim should be tested. Within a few minutes cups of tea with milk had been prepared and presented to the woman for tasting.\nAt this point, you may be wondering who the innovative scientist was and what the results of the experiment were. The scientist was R. A. Fisher, who first described this situation as a pedagogical example in his 1925 book on statistical methodology[^1]. Fisher developed statistical methods that are among the most important and widely used methods to this day, and most of his applications were biological.\n\nGame\nLet’s try an experiment. I’ll flip 10 coins. You guess which are heads and which are tails, and we’ll see how you do. Please write down a sequence of “H” or “T”. Comparing with your classmates, we will undoubtedly see that some of you did better and others worse.\nWhat would be your impression of one of you got 9 guesses correct? Is that SKILL or is that something else? What would be your immediate reaction and next move?\nAnalysis\nBack to the Lady who drank Tea !!\n\nLet’s suppose we decide to test the lady with ten cups of tea. We’ll flip a coin to decide which way to prepare the cups. If we flip a head, we will pour the milk in first; if tails, we put the tea in first. Then we present the ten cups to the lady and have her state which ones she thinks were prepared each way.\nIt is easy to give her a score (9 out of 10, or 7 out of 10, or whatever it happens to be). It is trickier to figure out what to do with her score. Even if she is just guessing and has no idea, she could get lucky and get quite a few correct – maybe even all 10. But how likely is that?\nNow let’s suppose the lady gets 9 out of 10 correct. That’s not perfect, but it is better than we would expect for someone who was just guessing. On the other hand, it is not impossible to get 9 out of 10 just by guessing.\nSo here is Fisher’s great idea: Let’s figure out how hard it is to get 9 out of 10 by guessing. If it’s not so hard to do, then perhaps that’s just what happened ( that she was guessing ), so we won’t be too impressed with the lady’s tea tasting ability. On the other hand, if it is really unusual to get 9 out of 10 correct by guessing, then we will have some evidence that she must be able to tell something ( and has an unusual Skill).\nBut how do we figure out how unusual it is to get 9 out of 10 just by guessing? Let’s just flip a bunch of coins and keep track. If the lady is just guessing, she might as well be flipping a coin.\nSo here’s the plan. We’ll flip 10 coins, and repeat that experiment 10000 times. We’ll call the heads correct guesses and the tails incorrect guesses.\n\n\n\nheads\n   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10 \n   9  110  413 1145 2096 2446 2066 1141  469   97    8 \n\n\n\n\n\nSo what do we conclude? It is possible that the lady could get 9 or 10 correct just by guessing, but it is not very likely (it only happened in about \\(\\frac{97+8}{10000} = 1.05\\%\\) of our simulations). So one of two things must be true:\n• The lady got unusually “lucky”, by chance; OR\n• The lady is not just guessing and really has some ability in this regard."

    "text": "Commentary\nFirst we realize something is surprising, and that we have a question or doubt. This is based on something we see, or measure, a test statistic. In our story, it is the score of \\(10/10\\) that the Lady was able to achieve about how the Tea was made.\nWe then assume the Lady is guessing and somehow by chance able to guess correctly. This would be our….NULL Hypothesis. This is our (conservative) belief about the Real World.\nWe then randomly generate many Parallel Counterfactual Worlds, where we repeat the experiment many many times, each time calculating the test statistic, under the assumption of the NULL Hypothesis is TRUE.\nWe see how often our Parallel Worlds can mimic or exceed Real World measurement of the the test statistic by comparison. If this is common (i.e. probability is high) we say we cannot reject the NULL Hypothesis (and the Lady is lucky). If the occurrence is rare, as in our case, we say we have reason to reject the NULL Hypothesis and reason to believe an underlying pattern (and Lady’s ability is beyond Question !)\nThis is the essence of the Simulation Method in statistical modelling. Take one more look at the picture from Allen Downey’s blog, below:"

    "text": "Hypothesis Testing using Permutation\nFrom Reference #1:\n\nHypothesis testing can be thought of as a 4-step process:\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses.\nCompute a test statistic.\nDetermine the p-value.\n\nDraw a conclusion.\nIn a traditional introductory statistics course, once this general framework has been mastered, the main work is in applying the correct formula to compute the standard test statistics in step 2 and using a table or computer to determine the p-value based on the known (usually approximate) theoretical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\nIn a simulation-based approach, steps 2 and 3 change. In Step 2, it is no longer required that the test statistic be normalized to conform with a known, named distribution. Instead, natural test statistics, like the difference between two sample means \\(y1 − y2\\) can be used.\nIn Step 3, we use randomization to approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistic. Our lady tasting tea example demonstrates how this can be done from first principles. More typically, we will use randomization to create new simulated data sets ( “Parallel Worlds”) that are like our original data in some ways, but make the null hypothesis true. For each simulated data set, we calculate our test statistic, just as we did for the original sample. Together, this collection of test statistics computed from the simulated samples constitute our randomization distribution.\nWhen creating a randomization distribution, we will attempt to satisfy 3 guiding principles.\n\nBe consistent with the null hypothesis. We need to simulate a world in which the null hypothesis is true. If we don’t do this, we won’t be testing our null hypothesis.\nUse the data in the original sample. The original data should shed light on some aspects of the distribution that are not determined by null hypothesis. For example, a null hypothesis about a mean doesn’t tell us about the shape of the population distribution, but the data give us some indication.\nReflect the way the original data were collected.\n\n\nFrom Chihara and Hesterberg:\n\nThis is the core idea of statistical significance or classical hypothesis testing – to calculate how often pure random chance would give an effect as large as that observed in the data, in the absence of any real effect. If that probability is small enough, we conclude that the data provide convincing evidence of a real effect.\n\nPermutations tests using mosaic::shuffle()\n\nThe mosaic package provides the shuffle() function as a synonym for sample(). When used without additional arguments, this will permute its first argument.\n\n# library(mosaic)\nshuffle(1:10)\n\n [1]  5  3  2  9  6 10  4  8  1  7\n\n\nApplying shuffle() to an explanatory variable in a model allows us to test the null hypothesis that the explanatory variable has, in fact, no explanatory power. This idea can be used to test\n\nthe equivalence of two or more means,\nthe equivalence of two or more proportions,\nwhether a regression parameter is 0. (Correlations between two variables)\n\nWe will now see examples of each of these models using Permutations."

We will now use this philosophy to develop a technique that allows us to mechanize several Statistical Models in that way, with nearly identical code.\nWe will use two packages in R, mosaic to develop our intuition for what are called permutation based statistical tests. (There is also a more recent package called infer in R which can do pretty much all of this, including visualization. In my opinion, the code is a little too high-level and does not offer quite the detailed insight that the mosaic package does)."

To do this we perform a simple check on the Contingency Table. We first re-compute the totals in each row and column, based on what we could expect if there was independence (NULL Hypothesis). If the two variables were independent, then there should be no difference between real and expected scores.\nHow do we know what scores to expect?\nConsider the entry in location (1,1): 117. The number of expected entries there is probability of an entry landing in that square times the total number of entries:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\text{Expected Value at location[1,1]}\n&= p_{row_1} * p_{col_1} * \\text{Total Scores}\\\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\text{Row-1-Total}}{\\text{Total Scores}} * \\frac{\\text{Col-1-Total}}{\\text{Total Scores}} * \\text{Total Scores}\\\\\\\n&= \\frac{898}{1307} * \\frac{189}{1307} * 1307\\\\\\\n&= 130\n\n\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nProceeding in this way for all the 15 entries in the Contingency Table, we get the “Expected” Contingency Table.

We note in passing that, in this case, since the number of cases in each cell of the Contingency Table are fairly high ( >= 5) the resulting NULL distribution is of the \\(X^2\\) variety."

Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.\nFirst, let’s create a new variable physical_3plus, which will be coded as either “yes” if the student is physically active for at least 3 days a week, and “no” if not. Recall that we have several missing data in that column, so we will (sadly) drop these before generating the new variable:\n\nyrbss <- yrbss %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  mutate(physical_3plus = if_else(physically_active_7d >= 2, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n         physical_3plus = factor(physical_3plus, \n                                 labels = c(\"yes\", \"no\"),\n                                 levels = c(\"yes\", \"no\")))\n# Let us check\nyrbss %>% count(physical_3plus)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nMake a side-by-side violin box plots of physical_3plus and weight.\nIs there a relationship between these two variables?

For this hypothesis, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no.\nAfter you have calculated your observed statistic, you need to create a permutation distribution. This is the distribution that is created by shuffling the observed weights into new physical_3plus groups, labeled “yes” and “no”.\nWe will save the permutation distribution as null_dist.\n\nnull_dist <- yrbss %>%\n  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"yes\", \"no\"))\n\nThe hypothesize() function is used to declare what the null hypothesis is. Here, we are assuming that student’s weight is independent of whether they exercise at least 3 days or not.\nWe should also note that the type argument within generate() is set to \"permute\". This ensures that the statistics calculated by the calculate() function come from a reshuffling of the data (not a resampling of the data)! Finally, the specify() and calculate() steps should look familiar, since they are the same as what we used to find the observed difference in means!\nWe can visualize this null distribution with the following code:\n\ngf_histogram(data = null_dist, ~ stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAdd a vertical red line to the plot above, demonstrating where the observed difference in means (obs_diff_mosaic) falls on the distribution.\nHow many of these null_dist permutations have a difference at least as large (or larger) as obs_diff_mosaic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have calculated the observed statistic and generated a permutation distribution, you can calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function get_p_value() from the infer package.\n\nnull_dist %>%\n  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_infer, direction = \"two_sided\")\n\nWarning: Please be cautious in reporting a p-value of 0. This result is an\napproximation based on the number of `reps` chosen in the `generate()` step.\nSee `?get_p_value()` for more information.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat warning message do you get? Why do you think you get this warning message?\nConstruct and record a confidence interval for the difference between the weights of those who exercise at least three times a week and those who don’t, and interpret this interval in context of the data.\n\n\n\n\nWe already have the observed difference, obs_diff_mosaic. Now we generate the null distribution using permutation, with mosaic:\n\nnull_dist_mosaic <- do(1000) * diffmean(~ weight | shuffle(physical_3plus), data = yrbss)\n\nWe can also generate the histogram of the null distribution, compare that with the observed diffrence and compute the p-value and confidence intervals:\n\ngf_histogram(~ diffmean, data = null_dist_mosaic) %>% \n  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_mosaic, colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\n# p-value\nprop(~ diffmean >= obs_diff_mosaic, data = null_dist_mosaic)\n\nprop_TRUE \n        0 \n\n# Confidence Intervals for p = 0.95\nmosaic::cdata(~ diffmean, p = 0.95, data = null_dist_mosaic)"

The data set FlightDelays contains information on all 4029 departures of these two airlines from LGA during May and June 2009.\n\ndata(\"FlightDelays\")\ninspect(FlightDelays)\n\n\ncategorical variables:  \n         name  class levels    n missing\n1     Carrier factor      2 4029       0\n2 Destination factor      7 4029       0\n3  DepartTime factor      5 4029       0\n4         Day factor      7 4029       0\n5       Month factor      2 4029       0\n6   Delayed30 factor      2 4029       0\n                                   distribution\n1 AA (72.1%), UA (27.9%)                       \n2 ORD (44.3%), DFW (22.8%), MIA (15.1%) ...    \n3 8-Noon (26.1%), Noon-4pm (26%) ...           \n4 Fri (15.8%), Mon (15.6%), Tue (15.6%) ...    \n5 June (50.4%), May (49.6%)                    \n6 No (85.2%), Yes (14.8%)                      \n\nquantitative variables:  \n          name   class min   Q1 median   Q3  max      mean         sd    n\n1           ID integer   1 1008   2015 3022 4029 2015.0000 1163.21645 4029\n2     FlightNo integer  71  371    691  787 2255  827.1035  551.30939 4029\n3 FlightLength integer  68  155    163  228  295  185.3011   41.78783 4029\n4        Delay integer -19   -6     -3    5  693   11.7379   41.63050 4029\n  missing\n1       0\n2       0\n3       0\n4       0\n\n\nThe variables in the FlightDelays dataset are:\nHypothesis Specification\nLet us compute the proportion of times that each carrier’s flights was delayed more than 20 min.

    "text": "Hypothesis Testing using Permutation\nFrom Reference #1:\n\nHypothesis testing can be thought of as a 4-step process:\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses.\nCompute a test statistic.\nDetermine the p-value.\n\nDraw a conclusion.\nIn a traditional introductory statistics course, once this general framework has been mastered, the main work is in applying the correct formula to compute the standard test statistics in step 2 and using a table or computer to determine the p-value based on the known (usually approximate) theoretical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\nIn a simulation-based approach, steps 2 and 3 change. In Step 2, it is no longer required that the test statistic be normalized to conform with a known, named distribution. Instead, natural test statistics, like the difference between two sample means \\(y1 − y2\\) can be used.\nIn Step 3, we use randomization to approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistic. Our lady tasting tea example demonstrates how this can be done from first principles. More typically, we will use randomization to create new simulated data sets ( “Parallel Worlds”) that are like our original data in some ways, but make the null hypothesis true. For each simulated data set, we calculate our test statistic, just as we did for the original sample. Together, this collection of test statistics computed from the simulated samples constitute our randomization distribution.\nWhen creating a randomization distribution, we will attempt to satisfy 3 guiding principles.\n\nBe consistent with the null hypothesis. We need to simulate a world in which the null hypothesis is true. If we don’t do this, we won’t be testing our null hypothesis.\nUse the data in the original sample. The original data should shed light on some aspects of the distribution that are not determined by null hypothesis. For example, a null hypothesis about a mean doesn’t tell us about the shape of the population distribution, but the data give us some indication.\nReflect the way the original data were collected.\n\n\nFrom Chihara and Hesterberg:\n\nThis is the core idea of statistical significance or classical hypothesis testing – to calculate how often pure random chance would give an effect as large as that observed in the data, in the absence of any real effect. If that probability is small enough, we conclude that the data provide convincing evidence of a real effect.\n\nPermutations tests using mosaic::shuffle()\n\nThe mosaic package provides the shuffle() function as a synonym for sample(). When used without additional arguments, this will permute its first argument.\n\nshuffle(1:10)\n\n [1]  8  7  5  6  1 10  4  2  3  9\n\n\nApplying shuffle() to an explanatory variable in a model allows us to test the null hypothesis that the explanatory variable has, in fact, no explanatory power. This idea can be used to test\n\nthe equivalence of two or more means,\nthe equivalence of two or more proportions,\nwhether a regression parameter is 0.\n\nWe will now see examples of each of these models using Permutations."

    "text": "Testing for Two or More Means\nCase Study-1: Hot Wings Orders vs Gender (From Chihara and Hesterberg)\nA student conducted a study of hot wings and beer consumption at a Bar. She asked patrons at the bar to record their consumption of hot wings and beer over the course of several hours. She wanted to know if people who ate more hot wings would then drink more beer. In addition, she investigated whether or not gender had an impact on hot wings or beer consumption. Is the mean order value related to the gender of the person who is ordering?\n\n\n\n\n\ndata(\"Beerwings\")\ninspect(Beerwings)\n\n\ncategorical variables:  \n    name  class levels  n missing                                  distribution\n1 Gender factor      2 30       0 F (50%), M (50%)                             \n\nquantitative variables:  \n      name   class min    Q1 median    Q3 max     mean        sd  n missing\n1       ID integer   1  8.25   15.5 22.75  30 15.50000  8.803408 30       0\n2 Hotwings integer   4  8.00   12.5 15.50  21 11.93333  4.784554 30       0\n3     Beer integer   0 24.00   30.0 36.00  48 26.20000 11.842064 30       0\n\n\nLet us calculate the observed difference in Hotwings consumption between Males and Females ( Gender): (using the mosaic package)\n\nmosaic::mean(Hotwings ~ Gender, data = Beerwings)\n\n        F         M \n 9.333333 14.533333 \n\nobs_diff_wings <- mosaic::diffmean(data = Beerwings, Hotwings ~ Gender)\nobs_diff_wings \n\ndiffmean \n     5.2 \n\n\n\ngf_boxplot(data = Beerwings, Hotwings ~ Gender, title = \"Hotwings Consumption by Gender\") %>%  gf_theme(theme_classic)\n\n\n\n\nThe observed difference in mean consumption of Hotwings between Males and Females is 5.2. There is also a “visible” difference in medians as seen from the pair of box plots above.\nCould this have occurred by chance? Here is our formulation of the Hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu_M\\ = \\mu_F\\\\\nH_a: \\mu_M\\ \\ne \\mu_F\\\\\n\\]Note that we have a two-sided test: we want to check for differences in mean order value, either way. So we perform a Permutation Test to check: we create a null distribution of the differences in mean by a shuffle operation on gender:\n\nnull_dist_wings <- do(1000) * diffmean(Hotwings ~ shuffle(Gender), data = Beerwings)\nnull_dist_wings %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngf_histogram(data = null_dist_wings, ~ diffmean) %>% \n  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_wings, colour = \"red\") %>% gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\ngf_ecdf(data = null_dist_wings, ~ diffmean) %>% \n  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_wings, colour = \"red\") %>% gf_theme(theme_classic())\n\n\n\nprop1(~ diffmean >= obs_diff_wings, data = null_dist_wings)\n\n  prop_TRUE \n0.001998002 \n\n\nThe \\(\\color{red}{red\\ line}\\) shows the actual measured mean difference in Hot Wings consumption. The probability that our Permutation distribution is able to equal or exceed that number is \\(0.001998002\\) and we have to reject the Null Hypothesis that the means are identical.\nMatched Pairs: Results from a diving championship.\nSometimes the data is collected on the same set of individual categories, e.g. scores by sport persons in two separate tournaments, or sales of identical items in two separate locations of a chain store. Here we have swimming records across a Semi-Final and a Final:\n\ndata(\"Diving2017\")\nhead(Diving2017)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ninspect(Diving2017)\n\n\ncategorical variables:  \n     name  class levels  n missing\n1    Name factor     12 12       0\n2 Country factor      8 12       0\n                                   distribution\n1  SI Yajie (8.3%) ...                         \n2 Canada (16.7%), China (16.7%) ...            \n\nquantitative variables:  \n       name   class    min       Q1  median      Q3   max    mean       sd  n\n1 Semifinal numeric 313.70 322.2000 325.625 356.575 382.8 338.500 22.94946 12\n2     Final numeric 283.35 318.5875 358.925 387.150 397.5 350.475 40.02204 12\n  missing\n1       0\n2       0\n\n\nThe data is made up of paired observations per swimmer. So we need to take the difference between the two swim records for each swimmer and then shuffle the differences to either polarity. Another way to look at this is to shuffle the records between Semifinal and Final on a per Swimmer basis. There are 12 swimmers and therefore 12 paired records.\nIn order to ensure that the records are paired, we use the argument only.2=FALSE in the diffmean function:\n\nDiving2017\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nDiving2017 %>% diffmean(data = ., Final ~ Semifinal, only.2 = FALSE)\n\n  318.7-313.7  320.55-318.7 322.75-320.55  325.5-322.75  325.75-325.5 \n       12.350       -63.050         5.225        85.125      -114.150 \n   346-325.75    355.15-346 360.85-355.15  367.5-360.85   382.8-367.5 \n      102.200       -54.150        28.600        31.950         4.050 \n\nobs_diff_swim <- mean(~ Final - Semifinal, data = Diving2017)\nobs_diff_swim\n\n[1] 11.975\n\n\nHow would we formulate our Hypothesis?\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu_{semifinal} = \\mu_{final}\\\\\nH_a: \\mu_{semifinal} \\ne \\mu_{final}\\\n\\]\n\npolarity <- c(rep(1, 6), rep(-1, 6)) \n# 12 +/- 1s, \n# 6 each to make sure there is equal probability\npolarity\n\n [1]  1  1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n\nnull_dist_swim <- do(100000) *\n  mean(data = Diving2017,\n       ~ (Final - Semifinal) * resample(polarity, replace = TRUE))\n\nnull_dist_swim %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngf_histogram(data = null_dist_swim, ~ mean) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_swim, colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\ngf_ecdf(data = null_dist_swim, ~ mean) %>%\n  gf_vline(xintercept = obs_diff_swim, colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\nprop1(~ mean >= obs_diff_swim, data = null_dist_swim)\n\nprop_TRUE \n0.1277987 \n\n\nHmm…so by generating 100000 shufflings of score differences, with polarities, it does appear that we can not only obtain the current observed difference but even surpass it frequently. So it does seem that there is no difference in means between Semi-Final and Final swimming scores.\nWalmart vs Target\nIs there a difference in the price of Groceries sold by the two retailers Target and Walmart? The data set Groceries contains a sample of grocery items and their prices advertised on their respective web sites on one specific day.\n\nInspect the data set, then explain why this is an example of matched pairs data.\nCompute summary statistics of the prices for each store.\nConduct a permutation test to determine whether or not there is a difference in the mean prices.\nCreate a histogram bar-chart of the difference in prices. What is unusual about Quaker Oats Life cereal?\nRedo the hypothesis test without this observation. Do you reach the same conclusion?\n\n\ndata(\"Groceries\")\nGroceries <- Groceries %>% mutate(Product = stringr::str_squish(Product))\nhead(Groceries)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ninspect(Groceries)\n\n\ncategorical variables:  \n      name     class levels  n missing\n1  Product character     30 30       0\n2     Size character     24 30       0\n3    Units character     16 30       0\n4 UnitType character      3 30       0\n                                   distribution\n1 Annie's Macaroni & Cheese (3.3%) ...         \n2 18oz (10%), 12oz (6.7%) ...                  \n3 10 (10%), 15 (10%), 16 (10%) ...             \n4 oz (93.3%), bars (3.3%) ...                  \n\nquantitative variables:  \n     name   class  min     Q1 median    Q3  max     mean       sd  n missing\n1  Target numeric 0.99 1.8275  2.545 3.140 7.99 2.762333 1.582128 30       0\n2 Walmart numeric 1.00 1.7600  2.340 2.955 6.98 2.705667 1.560211 30       0\n\n\nWe see that the comparison is to be made between two prices for the same product, and hence this is one more example of paired data, as in Case Study #4. Let us plot the prices for the products:\n\ngf_col(data = Groceries,\n       Target ~ Product,\n       fill = \"#0073C299\",\n       width = 0.5 ) %>% \n  gf_col(data = Groceries,\n         -Walmart ~ Product,\n         fill = \"#EFC00099\",\n         ylab = \"Prices\",\n         width = 0.5\n       ) %>% \n  gf_col(data = Groceries %>% filter(Product == \"Quaker Oats Life Cereal Original\"), \n         -Walmart ~ Product,\n         fill = \"red\", \n         width = 0.5) %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%\n  gf_theme(ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = element_text(\n    size = 8,\n    face = \"bold\",\n    vjust = 0,\n    hjust = 1\n  ))) %>% gf_theme(ggplot2::coord_flip())\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the price difference between Walmart and Target prices is highest for the Product named Quaker Oats Life Cereal Original.

Given computing power, we can always mechanize this test very quickly to get our results. And that performing this test yields reliable results without having to rely on any assumption relating to underlying distributions and so on."

Within the package, the functions that start, or execute, the data transformations are named after cooking actions. That makes the interface more user-friendly. For example:\n\nrecipe() - Starts a new set of transformations to be applied, similar to the ggplot() command. Its main argument is the model’s formula.\nprep() - Executes the transformations on top of the data that is supplied (typically, the training data). Each data transformation is a step() function. ( Recall what we did with the caret package: Centering, Scaling, Removing Correlated variables…)\n\nNote that in order to avoid data leakage (e.g: transferring information from the train set into the test set), data should be “prepped” using the train_tbl only. https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-with-tidymodels-and-parsnip-bae2c01c131c CRAN: The idea is that the preprocessing operations will all be created using the training set and then these steps will be applied to both the training and test set.\n\n# Pre Processing the Training Data\n\niris_recipe <- \n  training(iris_split) %>% # Note: Using TRAINING data !!\n  recipe(Species ~ .)      # Note: Outcomes ~ Predictors !!\n\n# The data contained in the `data` argument need not be the training set; this data is only used to catalog the names of the variables and their types (e.g. numeric, etc.).\n\nQ: How does the recipe “figure” out which are the outcomes and which are the predictors? A.The recipe command defines Outcomes and Predictors using the formula interface. Not clear how this recipe “figures” out which are the outcomes and which are the predictors, when we have not yet specified them…\nQ. Why is the recipe not agnostic to data set? Is that a meaningful question? A. The use of the training set in the recipe command is just to declare the variables and specify the roles of the data, nothing else. Roles are open-ended and extensible. From https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recipes/vignettes/Simple_Example.html :\n\nThis document demonstrates some basic uses of recipes. First, some definitions are required: - variables are the original (raw) data columns in a data frame or tibble. For example, in a traditional formula Y ~ A + B + A:B, the variables are A, B, and Y. - roles define how variables will be used in the model. Examples are: predictor (independent variables), response, and case weight. This is meant to be open-ended and extensible. - terms are columns in a design matrix such as A, B, and A:B. These can be other derived entities that are grouped, such as a set of principal components or a set of columns, that define a basis function for a variable. These are synonymous with features in machine learning. Variables that have predictor roles would automatically be main effect terms.\n\n\n# Apply the transformation steps\niris_recipe <- iris_recipe %>% \n  step_corr(all_predictors()) %>% \n  step_center(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n  step_scale(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n  prep()\n\nThis has created the recipe() and prepped it too. We now need to apply it to our datasets:\n\nTake training data and bake() it to prepare it for modelling.\nDo the same for the testing set.\n\n\niris_training_baked <- \n  iris_split %>% \n  training() %>% \n  bake(iris_recipe,.)\niris_training_baked\n\n\n\n  \n\n\niris_testing_baked <- \n  iris_split %>% \n  testing() %>% \n  bake(iris_recipe,.)\niris_testing_baked \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIris Model Training using parsnip\n\nDifferent ML packages provide different interfaces (APIs ) to do the same thing (e.g random forests). The tidymodels package provides a consistent interface to invoke a wide variety of packages supporting a wide variety of models.\nThe parsnip package is a successor to caret.\nTo model with parsnip: 1. Pick a model : 2. Set the engine 3. Set the mode (if needed): Classification or Regression\nCheck here for models available in parsnip.\n\nMode: classification and regression in parsnip, each using a variety of models. ( Which Way). This defines the form of the output.\nEngine: The engine is the R package that is invoked by parsnip to execute the model. E.g glm, glmnet,keras.( How ) parsnip provides wrappers for models from these packages.\nModel: is the specific technique used for the modelling task. E.g linear_reg(), logistic_reg(), mars, decision_tree, nearest_neighbour…(What model).\n\nand models have: - hyperparameters: that are numerical or factor variables that tune the model ( Like the alpha beta parameters for Bayesian priors)\nWe can use the random forest model to classify the iris into species. Here Species is the Outcome variable and the rest are predictor variables. The random forest model is provided by the ranger package, to which tidymodels/parsnip provides a simple and consistent interface.\n\nlibrary(ranger)\niris_ranger <- \n  rand_forest(trees = 100) %>% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"ranger\") %>% \n  fit(Species ~ ., data = iris_training_baked)\n\nranger can generate random forest models for classification, regression, survival( time series, time to event stuff). Extreme Forests are also supported, wherein all points in the dataset are used ( instead of bootstrap samples) along with feature bagging. We can also run the same model using the randomForest package:\n\nlibrary(randomForest,quietly = TRUE)\n\nrandomForest 4.7-1.1\n\n\nType rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'randomForest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ranger':\n\n    importance\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    margin\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\niris_rf <- \n  rand_forest(trees = 100) %>% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"randomForest\") %>% \n  fit(Species ~ ., data = iris_training_baked)\n\nIris Predictions\nThe predict() function run against a parsnip model returns a prediction tibble. By default, the prediction variable is called .pred_class.\n\npredict(object = iris_ranger, new_data = iris_testing_baked) %>%  \n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 60\nColumns: 5\n$ .pred_class  <fct> setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s…\n$ Sepal.Length <dbl> -0.8384977, -0.9624136, -1.7059090, -0.4667499, -1.210245…\n$ Sepal.Width  <dbl> 0.9083583, 0.6954619, -0.3690206, 1.3341513, -0.1561241, …\n$ Petal.Width  <dbl> -1.2726177, -1.2726177, -1.2726177, -1.2726177, -1.409132…\n$ Species      <fct> setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s…\n\n\nIris Classification Model Validation\nWe use metrics() function from the yardstick package to evaluate how good the model is.\n\npredict(iris_ranger, iris_testing_baked) %>%\n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  yardstick::metrics(truth = Species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can also check the metrics for randomForest model:\n\npredict(iris_rf, iris_testing_baked) %>%\n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  yardstick::metrics(truth = Species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIris Per-Classifier Metrics\nWe can use the parameter type = \"prob\" in the predict() function to obtain a probability score on each prediction. TBD: How is this prob calculated? Possible answer: the Random Forest model outputs its answer by majority voting across n trees. Each of the possible answers( i.e. predictions) for a particular test datum gets a share of the vote, that represents its probability. Hence each dataum in the test vector can show a probability for the “winning” answer. ( Quite possibly we can get the probabilities for all possible outcomes for each test datum)\n\niris_ranger_probs <- \n  predict(iris_ranger, iris_testing_baked, type = \"prob\") %>%\n

Let us choose species.\nWhen we look at the FEATURE columns, We would need to formulate questions based on entire columns at a time. For instance:\n\n\n“Is the bill_length_mm* greater than 45mm?” considers the entire bill_length_mm* FEATURE column\nIs the sex female? considers the entire sex column\n\nIf the specific FEATURE column is a Numerical (N) variable, the question would use some “thresholding” as shown in the question above, to convert the Numerical Variable into a Categorical variable.\nIf a specific FEATURE column is a Categorical (C) variable, the question would be like a filter operation in Excel.\nEither way, we end up answering with a smaller and smaller subset of rows in the dataset, to which the questions are answered with a Yes. It is as if we played many 20 Questions games in parallel, since there are so many simultaneous “answers”!\nOnce we exhaust all the FEATURE columns, then what remains is a subset (i.e. rows) of the original dataset and we read off the TARGET column, which should now contain a set of identical entries, e.g. “Adelie”. Thus we can extend a single-target 20Q game to a multiple-target one using a larger dataset. ( Note how the multiple targets are all the same: “Adelie”, or “Gentoo”, or “Chinstrap”)\nThis forms the basic intuition for a Machine Learning Algorithm called a Decision Tree.\nDecision Tree in Orange\nLet us visualize this Decision Tree in Orange. Look at the now famous penguins dataset, available here:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv\nWe see that there are three species of penguins, that live on three islands. The measurements for each penguin are flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and body_mass_g.\n\nTask 1: Create a few data visualizations for the variables, and pairs of variables from this dataset.\nTask 2: Can you inspect the visualizations and imagine how each of this dataset can be used in a 20 Questions Game, to create a Decision Tree for this dataset as shown below?\n\n\n\nPenguins Decision Tree!\n\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nThe 20Q Game can be viewed as a “Decision Tree” of Questions and Answers,\nEach fork in the game is a Question.\nDepending upon whether the current answer is yes or no, we turn in one direction or the other.\nEach of our questions is based on the information available in one or other of the columns!!\nWe arrive at a final “answer” or “target” after a particular sequence of yes/no answers. This is the one of the leaf nodes in the Tree.\nThe island and the species columns are categories and are especially suited to being the targets for a 20 Questions Game.\nWe can therefore use an entire column of data as our 20Questions target, rather than just one entity, person.\n\nThis is how we will use this Game as a Model for our first ML algorithm, classification using Decision Trees."

Each tree develops a question from this dataset, in a random fashion, using a randomly chosen variable. E.g. with penguins, if our target is species, then some trees will will use island, some others will use body_mass_g and some others may use bill_length_mm.\nEach tree will “grow its questions” in a unique way !! Since the questions are possibly based on a different variable at each time, the trees will grow in very different ways.\nStop when the required accuracy has been achieved (the sets contain observations/rows from only one species predominantly)\nWith the test set let each tree vote on which species it has decided upon.

We need use a distance measure to get the k closest entries of the new entry , the final decision is simple majority vote based the closest k neighbors. The distance metric could be euclidean or other similar ones.\n\n\nK-means: Given N n-dimension entries and classify them in k classes. At first, we randomly choose k entries and assign them to k clusters. They are the seed classes. Then we calculate the distance between each entry and each class. Each entry will be assigned into one class in terms of the its distance to each class, i.e., assign the entry to its closest class. After the assignment is complete, we then calculate the centroid of each class based on their new members. After the centroid calculation, we go back to the distance calculation and therefore new round classification. We stop the iteration when there is convergence,i.e,, no new centroid and classification.\nThe two methods are all semi-supervised learning algorithms because they do need we provide the number of clusters prior the clustering."

    "text": "A Bit of Forecasting?\nWe are always interested in the future. We will do this in three ways:\n\nuse Simple Exponential Smoothing\nuse a package called forecast to fit an ARIMA (Autoregressive Moving Average Integrated Model) model to the data and make predictions for weekly sales;\nAnd do the same using a package called prophet.\n\nForecasting using Exponential Smoothing\nFor example, the file contains total annual rainfall in inches for London, from 1813-1912 (original data from Hipel and McLeod, 1994).\n\nrain <- scan(\"https://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/hurst/precip1.dat\", skip = 2)\nrainseries <- ts(rain, start = c(1813))\nplot(rainseries)\n\n\n\n\nThere is a nearly constant value of about 25 around which there are random fluctuations and it seems to be an additive model. How can we make forecasts with this time series?\nA deliberate detour:\nLet’s see some quick notation to aid understanding: Much of smoothing is based on the high school concept of a straight line, \\(y = m*x + c\\).\nIn the following, we choose to describe the models with:\n\n\n\\(y\\) : the actual values in the time series\n\n\\(\\hat y\\) : our predictions from whichever model we create\n\n\\(l\\) : a level or mean as forecast;\n\n\\(b\\) : a trend variable; akin to the slope in the straight line equation;\n\n\\(s\\) : seasonal component of the time series. Note that this is a set of values that stretch over one cycle of the time series.\n\nIn Exponential Smoothing and Forecasting, we make three models of increasing complexity:\n\nSimple Exponential Model: Here we deal only with the mean or level aspect of the (decomposed) time series and make predictions with that.\nHolt Model: Here we use the level and the trend from the decomposed time series for predictions\nHolt-Winters Model: Here we use the level, the trend, and the seasonal component from the decomposed time series for predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n[<start>st]->[<input>input]\n[<input> input]->[<package> Time  Series|Decomposition]\n[<package> Time  Series|Decomposition]->[<component> Mean/Level]\n[<package> Time  Series|Decomposition]->[<component> Slope/Trend]\n[<package> Time  Series|Decomposition]->[<component> Seasonal]\n\n//Simple Exponential Smoothing\n[<component> Mean/Level]->[Delay A1]\n[Delay A1]->[Delay A2]\n[Delay A2]->[Delay A3]\n[Delay A3]...->...[Delay AN]\n[Delay A1]->[<state> A1]\n[Delay A2]->[<state> A2]\n[Delay A3]->[<state> A3]\n[Delay AN]->[<state> AN]\n[<state> AN]---([<note> $$alpha(1-alpha)^i$$]\n\n[<state> A1]->[<state> Add1]\n[<state> A2]->[<state> Add1]\n[<state> A3]->[<state> Add1]\n[<state> AN]->[<state> Add1]\n[<state> Add1]->[<end> Output]\n\n//Holt \n[<component> Slope/Trend]->[Delay B1]\n[Delay B1]->[Delay B2]\n[Delay B2]->[Delay B3]\n[Delay B3]...->...[Delay BN]\n[Delay B1]->[<state> B1]\n[Delay B2]->[<state> B2]\n[Delay B3]->[<state> B3]\n[Delay BN]->[<state> BN]\n[<state> BN]---([<note> $$beta(1-beta)^i$$]\n[<state> B1]->[<state> Add2]\n[<state> B2]->[<state> Add2]\n[<state> B3]->[<state> Add2]\n[<state> BN]->[<state> Add2]\n[<state> Add2]->[<end> Output]\n\n// Holt Winters\n[<component> Seasonal]->[Delay C1]\n[Delay C1]->[Delay C2]\n[Delay C2]->[Delay C3]\n[Delay C3]...->...[Delay CN]\n[Delay C1]->[<state> C1]\n[Delay C2]->[<state> C2]\n[Delay C3]->[<state> C3]\n[Delay CN]->[<state> CN]\n[<state> CN]---([<note> $$gamma(1-gamma)^i$$]\n[<state> C1]->[<state> Add3]\n[<state> C2]->[<state> Add3]\n[<state> C3]->[<state> Add3]\n[<state> CN]->[<state> Add3]\n[<state> Add3]->[<end> Output]\n\n// Final Output\n[<end> Output]->[<receiver> Forecast]\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Smoothing is smoothing based forecasting using just the level ( i.e. mean) of the Time Series to make forecasts.\nDouble exponential smoothing, or Holt Smoothing Model, is just exponential smoothing applied to both level and trend.\nThe idea behind triple exponential smoothing, or the Holt-Winters Smoothing Model, is to apply exponential smoothing to the seasonal components in addition to level and trend.\nWhat does “Exponential” mean?\nAll three models use memory: at each time instant in the Time Series, a set of past values, along with the present sample is used to make a prediction of the relevant parameter ( level / slope / seasonal). These are then added together to make the forecast.\nThe memory in each case controlled by a parameter: alpha for the estimate of the level beta for the slope estimate, and gamma for the seasonal component estimate at the current time point. All these parameters are between 0 and 1. The model takes a weighted average of past values of each parameter. The weights are derived in the form of \\(\\alpha(1-\\alpha)^i\\), where \\(i\\) defines how old the sample is compared to the present one, thus forming a set of weights that decrease exponentially with delay. Values of \\(\\alpha, \\beta. \\gamma\\) that are close to 0 mean that significant weightage is placed on observations in the past.(Memory is “stronger”). To express this in mathematical notation we now need three equations: one for level, one for the trend and one to combine the level and trend to get the expected \\(\\hat y\\).\nTo make forecasts using simple exponential smoothing in R, we can use the HoltWinters() function in R, or the forecast::ets() function from forecasts. This latter function is more powerful.\n\nargs(HoltWinters)\n\nfunction (x, alpha = NULL, beta = NULL, gamma = NULL, seasonal = c(\"additive\", \n    \"multiplicative\"), start.periods = 2, l.start = NULL, b.start = NULL, \n    s.start = NULL, optim.start = c(alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.1, \n        gamma = 0.1), optim.control = list()) \nNULL\n\nargs(forecast::ets)\n\nfunction (y, model = \"ZZZ\", damped = NULL, alpha = NULL, beta = NULL, \n    gamma = NULL, phi = NULL, additive.only = FALSE, lambda = NULL, \n    biasadj = FALSE, lower = c(rep(1e-04, 3), 0.8), upper = c(rep(0.9999, \n        3), 0.98), opt.crit = c(\"lik\", \"amse\", \"mse\", \"sigma\", \n        \"mae\"), nmse = 3, bounds = c(\"both\", \"usual\", \"admissible\"), \n    ic = c(\"aicc\", \"aic\", \"bic\"), restrict = TRUE, allow.multiplicative.trend = FALSE, \n    use.initial.values = FALSE, na.action = c(\"na.contiguous\", \n        \"na.interp\", \"na.fail\"), ...) \nNULL\n\n\nTo use HoltWinters() for simple exponential smoothing, we need to set the parameters beta=FALSE and gamma=FALSE in the HoltWinters() function (the beta and gamma parameters are used for double exponential smoothing, or triple exponential smoothing.\nTo use forecast::ets, we set the model argument to “ANN”, “AAN”, and “AAA” respectively for each of the three smoothing models.\nNote: The HoltWinters() function returns a list variable, that contains several named elements.\n\nrainseriesforecasts <- forecast::ets(rainseries, model = \"ANN\")\n# class(rainseriesforecasts)\n# str(rainseriesforecasts)\nplot(rainseriesforecasts)\n\n\n\nplot(forecast(rainseriesforecasts, 10))\n\n\n\n\nARIMA\nWe can also use past trends and seasonality in the data to make predictions about the future using the forecast package. Here we use an auto ARIMA model to guess at the trend in the time series. Then we use that model to forecast a few periods into the future.\nMathematically an ARIMA model can be shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the familiar Walmart Sales dataset, and try to predict weekly sales for one of the Departments.\n\ndata(\"walmart_sales_weekly\")\nwalmart_wide <- walmart_sales_weekly %>% \n  pivot_wider(., id_cols = c(Date), \n              names_from = Dept, \n              values_from = Weekly_Sales,\n              names_prefix = \"Sales_\")\n\n## forecast::auto.arima needs a SINGLE time series, so we pick one, Dept95\nsales_95_ts <- walmart_wide %>% \n  select(Sales_95) %>% \n  ts(start = c(2010,1), end = c(2012,52),frequency = 52)\nsales_95_ts\n\nTime Series:\nStart = c(2010, 1) \nEnd = c(2012, 52) \nFrequency = 52 \n  [1] 106690.06 111390.36 107952.07 103652.58 112807.75 112048.41 117716.13\n  [8] 113117.35 111466.37 116770.82 126341.84 110204.77 107648.14 125592.28\n [15] 120247.90 120036.99 121902.19 133056.97 131995.00 134118.05 120172.47\n [22] 124821.44 126241.20 121386.73 116256.35 108781.57 131128.96 131288.83\n [29] 124601.48 117929.58 124220.10 125027.49 124372.90 114702.69 113009.41\n [36] 120764.22 123510.99 110052.15 105793.40 110332.92 110209.31 107544.02\n [43] 106015.41 100834.31 111384.36 116521.67 121695.13  93676.95 107317.32\n [50] 109955.90 103724.16  99043.34 114270.08 117548.75 112165.80 107742.95\n [57] 116225.68 120621.32 123405.41 122280.13 112905.09 126746.25 126834.30\n [64] 118632.26 111764.31 120882.84 124953.94 112581.20 119815.67 135260.49\n [71] 136364.46 135197.63 121814.84 128054.88 133213.04 127906.50 121483.11\n [78] 117284.94 138538.47 138567.10 133260.84 122721.92 130446.34 133762.77\n [85] 133939.40 116165.28 115663.78 132805.42 125954.30 116931.34 108018.21\n [92] 114793.92 115047.16 113966.34 112688.97 102798.99 119053.80 120721.07\n [99] 125041.39  93358.91 116427.93 118685.12 113021.23 102202.04 115507.25\n[106] 125038.09 119807.63 110870.94 118406.27 125840.82 132318.50 117030.73\n[113] 127706.00 137958.76 129438.22 123172.79 118589.44 130920.36 131341.85\n[120] 129031.19 127603.00 130573.37 139857.10 140806.36 124594.40 131935.56\n[127] 148798.05 129724.74 126861.49 121030.79 134832.22 137408.20 136264.68\n[134] 118845.34 124741.33 140657.40 128542.73 119121.35 115326.47 127009.22\n[141] 124559.93 123346.24 117375.38 106690.06 111390.36 107952.07 103652.58\n[148] 112807.75 112048.41 117716.13 113117.35 111466.37 116770.82 126341.84\n[155] 110204.77 107648.14\n\narima_dept_95 <- forecast::auto.arima(y = sales_95_ts)\narima_dept_95\n\nSeries: sales_95_ts \nARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,0)[52] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1\n      -0.8842\ns.e.   0.0530\n\nsigma^2 = 29974424:  log likelihood = -1033.02\nAIC=2070.03   AICc=2070.15   BIC=2075.3\n\nplot(arima_dept_95)\n\n\n\n# Use the model to forecast 12 weeks into the future\nsales95_forecast <- forecast(arima_dept_95, h = 12)\n\n# Plot the forecast.

    "text": "Procedure\n\nWe start with an arbitrary point on the edge of the Feasibility Region. \\(A = (0,0)\\) is a common choice. At this point, since all variables are \\(0\\), the objective function is also \\(0\\).\nWe (arbitrarily) decide to move along the boundary of the Feasibility Region, to another FSP. We arbitrarily chose the \\(x_1\\) axis, and set/keep \\(x_2 = 0\\). We now wish to find out the \\(x_1\\) coordinate of the next FSP point. This would be at the intersection of the \\(x_1\\) axis and one of the Constraint lines.\nAll the three Constraint Lines would possibly intersect the \\(x_1\\) axis. We need to choose that intercept point that has the smallest, non-negative \\(x_1\\) intercept value. (Why?)\nSo, which Constraint Line intersects the \\(x_1\\) axis at the smallest value? Is it point B, or point F?\nTo find out, we substitute \\(x_2 = 0\\) in each of the Constraint equations, and solve for the \\(x_1\\):\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nC1: -3x_1 + 2 \\times 0 = 3 \\ => x_1 = \\color{red}{-1}\\\\\nC2: 2x_1 + 4\\times0 = 27 \\ => x_1 = 13.5\\ Point\\ F\\\\\n   {\\mathbf{ \\color{lightgreen}{C3}: 9x_1 + 10\\times0 = 90 \\ => x_1 = 10\\  \\color{lightgreen}{Point\\ B}}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nNegative values for any variable are not permitted. So the smallest value of intercept is \\(x_1 = 10\\) for Constraint \\(C3\\). We therefore move to point \\(B(10,0)\\). At this point the objective function has improved to:\n\n\\[\nObjective = 7.75\\times 10 + 10\\times0 = 77.5\\ at\\ Point\\ B\n\\]\n\nWe now start from Point B, and move to the next nearest point. In identical fashion to Step2, we “imagine” that we move along a new axis defined by:\\[\nIntercept = Point\\ B(10,0)\\\\\n\\] \\[\nEquation = Constraint\\ C3: 9x_1 + 10x_2 = 90\\\\\n\\] We express \\(x_1\\) in terms of \\(x_2\\) with \\(C3\\): \\[\n\\hat C3: x_1 = \\frac{90 - 10x_2}{9}\n\\] As in Step 2, we substitute this equation \\(\\hat C3\\) into the other two constraints, \\(C1\\) and \\(C2\\): \\[\n\\begin{cases}\nC1: -3\\times \\frac{90 - 10x_2}{9} + 2x_2 = 3 \\ => x_2 = 6.18\\ Point\\ K\\\\\n{\\mathbf{ \\color{lightgreen}{C2}: 2\\times \\frac{90 - 10x_2}{9}+ 4x_2 = 27 => x_2 = 3.93\\ \\color{lightgreen}{Point\\ C}}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] As before we choose the smaller of the two intercepts, so \\(x_2 = 3.93\\). Calculating for \\(x_1\\), we get point \\(C(5.63, 3.93)\\). At this point the objective function has improved to:\n\n\\[\n7.75\\times 5.63 + 10\\times 3.93 = 82.9\\ at\\ Point\\ C\n\\]\n\nWe now proceed along the constraint line \\(C2\\) towards the next point. In identical fashion to Step 2 and 3, we “imagine” that we move along a new axis defined by: \\[\nIntercept = Point\\ C(5.63,3.93)\n\\] \\[\nEquation = Constraint\\ C2: 2x_1 + 4x_2 = 27 \\\\\n\\] Again, We express \\(x_1\\) in terms of \\(x_2\\) with \\(C2\\) this time: \\[\n\\hat C2: x_1 = \\frac{27 - 4x_2}{2}\n\\] As in Step 2 and, we substitute this equation \\(\\hat C2\\) into the other constraint, the only remaining \\(C1\\): \\[\n{\\mathbf C1: -3\\times \\frac{27 - 4x_2}{2} + 2x_2 = 3 \\ => x_2 = 5.44\\ Point\\ D\\\\}\n\\] Calculating for \\(x_1\\), we get point \\(C(2.63, 5.44)\\). At this point the objective function has improved decreased to: \\[\n7.75\\times 2.63 + 10\\times 5.44 = 74.8\\ at\\ Point\\ D\n\\] Since this value for the Objective function is smaller than that at the previous point, our search terminates and we decide that Point \\(C(5.63,3.93)\\) is the optimal point.\nSo the final result is: \\[\n   x_1(max) = 5.63\\\\\n\\] \\[\n   x_2(max) = 3.93\\\\\n\\] \\[\n   Maximum\\ Objective\\ Function\\ Value = 82.9\n\\] The final result is plotted below:"

This adjacent point corresponds to the “tightening” of one or other of the Constraint equations(i.e. slack = 0 for that Constraint)\n\nCalculate the Objective function at that point.\n\nUse this new point as the next starting point and move along the Constraint line from the previous step.\n\nRepeat step 2 and 3, calculating the Objective function each time.\n\nKeep the solution point where the objective function hits a maximum, i.e. when moving to the next point reduces the value of the Objective function."

Let us choose species.\nWhen we look at the FEATURE columns, We would need to formulate questions based on entire columns at a time. For instance:\n\n\n“Is the bill_length_mm* greater than 45mm?” considers the entire bill_length_mm* FEATURE column\nIs the sex female? considers the entire sex column\n\nIf the specific FEATURE column is a Numerical (N) variable, the question would use some “thresholding” as shown in the question above, to convert the Numerical Variable into a Categorical variable.\nIf a specific FEATURE column is a Categorical (C) variable, the question would be like a filter operation in Excel.\nEither way, we end up answering with a smaller and smaller subset of rows in the dataset, to which the questions are answered with a Yes. It is as if we played many 20 Questions games in parallel, since there are so many simultaneous “answers”!\nOnce we exhaust all the FEATURE columns, then what remains is a subset (i.e. rows) of the original dataset and we read off the TARGET column, which should now contain a set of identical entries, e.g. “Adelie”. Thus we can extend a single-target 20Q game to a multiple-target one using a larger dataset. ( Note how the multiple targets are all the same: “Adelie”, or “Gentoo”, or “Chinstrap”)\nThis forms the basic intuition for a Machine Learning Algorithm called a Decision Tree.\nDecision Tree in Orange\nLet us visualize this Decision Tree in Orange. Look at the now famous penguins dataset, available here:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv\nWe see that there are three species of penguins, that live on three islands. The measurements for each penguin are flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and body_mass_g.\n\nTask 1: Create a few data visualizations for the variables, and pairs of variables from this dataset.\nTask 2: Can you inspect the visualizations and imagine how each of this dataset can be used in a 20 Questions Game, to create a Decision Tree for this dataset as shown below?\n\n\n\nPenguins Decision Tree!\n\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nThe 20Q Game can be viewed as a “Decision Tree” of Questions and Answers,\nEach fork in the game is a Question.\nDepending upon whether the current answer is yes or no, we turn in one direction or the other.\nEach of our questions is based on the information available in one or other of the columns!!\nWe arrive at a final “answer” or “target” after a particular sequence of yes/no answers. This is the one of the leaf nodes in the Tree.\nThe island and the species columns are categories and are especially suited to being the targets for a 20 Questions Game.\nWe can therefore use an entire column of data as our 20Questions target, rather than just one entity, person.\n\nThis is how we will use this Game as a Model for our first ML algorithm, classification using Decision Trees."

    "text": "How do we Make Predictions using our Decision Tree\nOur aim is to make predictions. Predictions of what? When we are given new unseen data in the same format, we should be able to predict TARGET variable using the same FEATURE columns.\nNOTE: This that is usually a class/category (We CAN also predict a numerical value with a Decision Tree; but we will deal with that later.)\nIn order to make predictions with completely unseen data, we need to first check if the algorithm is working well with known data. The way to do this is to use a large portion of data to design the tree, and then use the tree to predict some aspect of the remaining, but similar, data. Let us split the penguins dataset into two pieces: a training set to design our tree, and a test set to check how it is working.\nDownload this penguin tree file and open it in Orange.\nHow good are the Predictions? What is the Classification Error Rate?"

    "text": "How Many Trees do we Need? Enter the Random Forest!\nCheck all your individual Decision Trees: do they ask the same Questions? Do they fork in the same way? Yes, they all seem to use the same set of parameters to reach the target. So they are capable of being “biased” and make the same mistakes. So we ask: Does it help to use more than one tree, if all the questions/forks in the Trees are similar?\nNo…we need different Trees to be able to ask different questions, based on different variables or features in the data. That will make the Trees as different as possible and so…unbiased. This is what we also saw when we played 20Q: offbeat questions opened up some avenues for predicting the answer/target.\nA forest of such trees is called the Wild Wood a Random Forest !"

    "text": "An Introduction to Random Forests\nIn the Random Forest method, we do as follows:\n\nSplit the dataset into training and test subsets (70::30 proportion is very common). Keep aside the testing dataset for final testing.\nDecide on a number of trees, say 100-500 in the forest.\nTake the training dataset and repeatedly sample some of the rows in it. Rows can be repeated too; this is called bootstrap sampling.\nGive this sampled training set to each tree. Each tree develops a question from this dataset, in a random fashion, using a randomly chosen variable. E.g. with penguins, if our target is species, then some trees will will use island, some others will use body_mass_g and some others may use bill_length_mm.\nEach tree will “grow its questions” in a unique way !! Since the questions are possibly based on a different variable at each time, the trees will grow in very different ways.\nStop when the required accuracy has been achieved (the sets contain observations/rows from only one species predominantly)\nWith the test set let each tree vote on which species it has decided upon. Take the majority vote.\n\nPhew!!\nLet’s get a visual sense of how all this works:\nhttps://waternova.github.io/random-forest-viz/"

Within the package, the functions that start, or execute, the data transformations are named after cooking actions. That makes the interface more user-friendly. For example:\n\nrecipe() - Starts a new set of transformations to be applied, similar to the ggplot() command. Its main argument is the model’s formula.\nprep() - Executes the transformations on top of the data that is supplied (typically, the training data). Each data transformation is a step() function. ( Recall what we did with the caret package: Centering, Scaling, Removing Correlated variables…)\n\nNote that in order to avoid data leakage (e.g: transferring information from the train set into the test set), data should be “prepped” using the train_tbl only. https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-with-tidymodels-and-parsnip-bae2c01c131c CRAN: The idea is that the preprocessing operations will all be created using the training set and then these steps will be applied to both the training and test set.\n\n# Pre Processing the Training Data\n\niris_recipe <- \n  training(iris_split) %>% # Note: Using TRAINING data !!\n  recipe(Species ~ .)      # Note: Outcomes ~ Predictors !!\n\n# The data contained in the `data` argument need not be the training set; this data is only used to catalog the names of the variables and their types (e.g. numeric, etc.).\n\nQ: How does the recipe “figure” out which are the outcomes and which are the predictors? A.The recipe command defines Outcomes and Predictors using the formula interface. Not clear how this recipe “figures” out which are the outcomes and which are the predictors, when we have not yet specified them…\nQ. Why is the recipe not agnostic to data set? Is that a meaningful question? A. The use of the training set in the recipe command is just to declare the variables and specify the roles of the data, nothing else. Roles are open-ended and extensible. From https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recipes/vignettes/Simple_Example.html :\n\nThis document demonstrates some basic uses of recipes. First, some definitions are required: - variables are the original (raw) data columns in a data frame or tibble. For example, in a traditional formula Y ~ A + B + A:B, the variables are A, B, and Y. - roles define how variables will be used in the model. Examples are: predictor (independent variables), response, and case weight. This is meant to be open-ended and extensible. - terms are columns in a design matrix such as A, B, and A:B. These can be other derived entities that are grouped, such as a set of principal components or a set of columns, that define a basis function for a variable. These are synonymous with features in machine learning. Variables that have predictor roles would automatically be main effect terms.\n\n\n# Apply the transformation steps\niris_recipe <- iris_recipe %>% \n  step_corr(all_predictors()) %>% \n  step_center(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n  step_scale(all_predictors(), -all_outcomes()) %>% \n  prep()\n\nThis has created the recipe() and prepped it too. We now need to apply it to our datasets:\n\nTake training data and bake() it to prepare it for modelling.\nDo the same for the testing set.\n\n\niris_training_baked <- \n  iris_split %>% \n  training() %>% \n  bake(iris_recipe,.)\niris_training_baked\n\n# A tibble: 90 × 4\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Width Species   \n          <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl> <fct>     \n 1      -0.759        2.41      -1.48   setosa    \n 2      -0.878        1.02      -1.35   setosa    \n 3       0.307       -1.08       0.193  virginica \n 4      -0.759        1.02      -1.35   setosa    \n 5       1.14        -0.616      0.193  versicolor\n 6      -1.47         0.782     -1.22   setosa    \n 7      -0.522        1.95      -1.10   setosa    \n 8      -0.0487      -1.08      -0.0644 versicolor\n 9       2.20        -0.150      1.35   virginica \n10       0.780       -0.150      1.22   virginica \n# … with 80 more rows\n\niris_testing_baked <- \n  iris_split %>% \n  testing() %>% \n  bake(iris_recipe,.)\niris_testing_baked \n\n# A tibble: 60 × 4\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Width Species\n          <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl> <fct>  \n 1      -1.35         0.316       -1.35 setosa \n 2      -0.522        1.48        -1.35 setosa \n 3      -1.23        -0.150       -1.48 setosa \n 4      -1.83        -0.150       -1.48 setosa \n 5      -0.0487       2.18        -1.35 setosa \n 6      -0.167        1.71        -1.22 setosa \n 7      -0.878        1.71        -1.22 setosa \n 8      -0.522        0.782       -1.35 setosa \n 9      -0.878        1.48        -1.10 setosa \n10      -1.35         0.316       -1.35 setosa \n# … with 50 more rows\n\n\nIris Model Training using parsnip\n\nDifferent ML packages provide different interfaces (APIs ) to do the same thing (e.g random forests). The tidymodels package provides a consistent interface to invoke a wide variety of packages supporting a wide variety of models.\nThe parsnip package is a successor to caret.\nTo model with parsnip: 1. Pick a model : 2. Set the engine 3. Set the mode (if needed): Classification or Regression\nCheck here for models available in parsnip.\n\nMode: classification and regression in parsnip, each using a variety of models. ( Which Way). This defines the form of the output.\nEngine: The engine is the R package that is invoked by parsnip to execute the model. E.g glm, glmnet,keras.( How ) parsnip provides wrappers for models from these packages.\nModel: is the specific technique used for the modelling task. E.g linear_reg(), logistic_reg(), mars, decision_tree, nearest_neighbour…(What model).\n\nand models have: - hyperparameters: that are numerical or factor variables that tune the model ( Like the alpha beta parameters for Bayesian priors)\nWe can use the random forest model to classify the iris into species. Here Species is the Outcome variable and the rest are predictor variables. The random forest model is provided by the ranger package, to which tidymodels/parsnip provides a simple and consistent interface.\n\nlibrary(ranger)\niris_ranger <- \n  rand_forest(trees = 100) %>% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"ranger\") %>% \n  fit(Species ~ ., data = iris_training_baked)\n\nranger can generate random forest models for classification, regression, survival( time series, time to event stuff). Extreme Forests are also supported, wherein all points in the dataset are used ( instead of bootstrap samples) along with feature bagging. We can also run the same model using the randomForest package:\n\nlibrary(randomForest,quietly = TRUE)\n\nrandomForest 4.7-1.1\n\n\nType rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'randomForest'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ranger':\n\n    importance\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    margin\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\niris_rf <- \n  rand_forest(trees = 100) %>% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"randomForest\") %>% \n  fit(Species ~ ., data = iris_training_baked)\n\nIris Predictions\nThe predict() function run against a parsnip model returns a prediction tibble. By default, the prediction variable is called .pred_class.\n\npredict(object = iris_ranger, new_data = iris_testing_baked) %>%  \n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 60\nColumns: 5\n$ .pred_class  <fct> setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s…\n$ Sepal.Length <dbl> -1.35138822, -0.52239642, -1.23296082, -1.82509781, -0.04…\n$ Sepal.Width  <dbl> 0.31591693, 1.48118431, -0.15019002, -0.15019002, 2.18034…\n$ Petal.Width  <dbl> -1.3532022, -1.3532022, -1.4820786, -1.4820786, -1.353202…\n$ Species      <fct> setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s…\n\n\nIris Classification Model Validation\nWe use metrics() function from the yardstick package to evaluate how good the model is.\n\npredict(iris_ranger, iris_testing_baked) %>%\n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  yardstick::metrics(truth = Species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n1 accuracy multiclass     0.967\n2 kap      multiclass     0.950\n\n\nWe can also check the metrics for randomForest model:\n\npredict(iris_rf, iris_testing_baked) %>%\n  dplyr::bind_cols(iris_testing_baked) %>% \n  yardstick::metrics(truth = Species, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n1 accuracy multiclass     0.95 \n2 kap      multiclass     0.925\n\n\nIris Per-Classifier Metrics\nWe can use the parameter type = \"prob\" in the predict() function to obtain a probability score on each prediction. TBD: How is this prob calculated? Possible answer: the Random Forest model outputs its answer by majority voting across n trees.

    "text": "There are many presentation and drawing tools out there. And these allow the user full control over the diagram so generally result in prettier diagrams that can convey more information to the audience at that point in time.\nBut that point in time passes, and pretty pictures can quickly become out-of-date and, ironically, misinforming if they don’t match the reality of the system they are describing. This is especially so if one team is drawing the pretty pictures, and another team is writing the software/implementing the system.\nHaving diagrams as code that can live beside the system design/code, that the stakeholders are equally comfortable editing and viewing,reduces the gap i.e. “Where system diagrams meet system reality”.\nWe will “explore” two packages to do this: DiagrammeR and nomnoml. Each of these follows a specific grammar so that sets of “sentences” will morph into very different kinds of diagrams."

For example, frequency=1 for monthly data.\nWe will pick simple numerical vector data ( i.e. not a timeseries ) ChickWeight:\n\nChickWeight %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nChickWeight_ts <- ts(ChickWeight$weight, frequency = 2)\nplot(ChickWeight_ts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `ts` format\n\n\n\nThe ts format is not recommended for new analysis since it does not permit inclusion of multiple time series in one dataset, nor other categorical variables for grouping etc.\n\n\n\ntibble format data\nSome “time-oriented” datasets are available in tibble form. Let us try to plot one, the walmart_sales_weekly dataset from the timetk package:\n\ndata(walmart_sales_weekly, package = \"timetk\")\nwalmart_sales_weekly\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis dataset is a tibble with a Date column. The Dept column is clearly a categorical column that allows us to distinguish separate time series, i.e. one for each value of Dept. We will convert that to a factor( it is an double precision number ) and then plot the data using this column on the Date on the \\(x\\)-axis:\n\nwalmart_sales_weekly %>% \n  \n  # convert Dept number to a **categorical factor**\n  mutate(Dept = forcats::as_factor(Dept)) %>% \n  \n  gf_point(Weekly_Sales ~ Date, \n           group = ~ Dept, \n           colour = ~ Dept, data = .) %>% \n  gf_line() %>% \n  gf_theme(theme_minimal())\n\n\n\n\nFor more analysis and forecasting etc., it is useful to convert this tibble into a tsibble:\n\nwalmart_tsibble <- as_tsibble(walmart_sales_weekly,\n                         index = Date,\n                         key = c(id, Dept))\nwalmart_tsibble\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe 7D states the data is weekly. There is a Date column and all the other numerical variables are time-varying quantities. The categorical variables such as id, and Dept allow us to identify separate time series in the data, and these have 7 combinations hence are 7 time series in this data, as indicated.\n\n\nLet us plot Weekly_Sales, colouring the time series by Dept:\n\nwalmart_tsibble %>% \n  gf_line(Weekly_Sales ~ Date, \n          colour = ~ as_factor(Dept), data = .) %>% \n  gf_point() %>% \n  labs(title = \"Weekly Sales by Dept at Walmart\")\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n$title\n[1] \"Weekly Sales by Dept at Walmart\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Walmart Time Series\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also do a quick autoplot that seems to offer less control and is also not interactive.\n\nwalmart_tsibble %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(Dept) %>% \n  autoplot(Weekly_Sales)\n\n`mutate_if()` ignored the following grouping variables:\n• Column `Dept`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntsibble format data\nIn the packages tsibbledata and fpp3 we have a good choice of tsibble format data. Let us pick one:\n\nhh_budget\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThere are 4 keys ( id variables ) here, one for each country. Six other quantitative columns are the individual series. Let us plot the timeseries:"

    "text": "Introduction\nChoropleth Map\nWhat does choropleth1 mean? And what kind of information could this map represent?1 Etymology. From Ancient Greek χώρα (khṓra, “location”) + πλῆθος (plêthos, “a great number”) + English map. First proposed in 1938 by American geographer John Kirtland Wright to mean “quantity in area,” although maps of the type have been used since the early 19th century.\n\n\nBubble Map\nWhat information could this map below represent?\n\n\nWhat is there to not like about maps!!! Let us now look at the slides. Then we will understand how the R packages sf, tmap work to create maps, using data downloadable into R using osmdata, osmplotr and rnaturalearth.\nWe will learn to make static and interactive maps and to show off different kinds of data on them, data that have an inherently “spatial” spread or significance! sf + ggplot and tmap give us great static maps. Interactive maps we will make with leaflet and mapview; tmap is also capable of creating interactive maps.\nTrade Routes? Populations? Street Crime hotspots? Theatre and Food districts and popular Restaurants? Literary Paris, London and Barcelona?\nAll possible !!"

    "text": "2 Structure\nThe total number of students were 17. Eight Pairs of students were created randomly to create eight different Test tools for Short Term Memory testing.\nThe binary ( two - level ) variables/parameters that were used in the tests, were, following Lawrance:\n\nWL: Word List Length ( 7 and 15 words )\n\nSL: Syllables in the Words ( 2 and 5 syllables )\n\nST: Study Time allowed for the Respondents ( 15 and 30 seconds )\n\nOther parameters considered were a) Language b) Structure/Depiction of the Word Lists ( e.g. word clouds, matrices, columns…), c) Whether the words would be shown or read aloud, and d) whether the respondents had to speak out, or write down, the recollected words. These parameters were discussed and abandoned as too complex to mechanize, though they could have had an impact on the STM scores.\nHence a total of 8 Tests were created by 8 pairs of students, and each team tested the remaining 15 students ( Due to COVID restrictions, this testing was carried out entirely online on MS Teams, using individual breakout rooms for the Test Teams. )\nThe data were entered into a Google Sheet and the STM scores were converted to percentages so as to be comparable across WL.\nThe data was then “flattened” for each of the binary parameters; this was logical to do since for each parameter, the other two parameters were balanced out by the Test structure. For instance, for WL = 5, the SL and ST parameters used all the four combinations ( SL = 5, 15 ) and (ST = 15, 30 ). Hence the “common sense” analysis could proceed for each of the parameters individually. Joint effects were not considered for this preliminary class."

The other columns are constructed similarly.\n\n3.1 Basic Plots\nWe will use Box Plots and Density Plots to compare the STM score distributions for each Parameter.

    "text": "5 Analysis\nWe wish to establish the significance of the effect size due to each of the Parameters. Already from the Density Plots, we can see that none of the scores are normally distributed. A quick Shapiro-Wilkes Test for each of them confirms that the scores are not normally distributed.\nHence we go for a Permutation Test to check for significance of effect.\nOn the other hand, as remarked in Ernst2, the non-parametric permutation test can be both exact and also intuitively easier for students to grasp, as I can testify from direct observation in this class. There is no need to discuss sampling distributions and means, t-tests and the like. Permutations are easily executed in R, using packages such as mosaic3.2 Ernst, Michael D. 2004. “Permutation Methods: A Basis for Exact Inference.” Statistical Science 19 (4): 676–85. doi:10.1214/088342304000000396.3 Pruim R, Kaplan DT, Horton NJ (2017). “The mosaic Package: Helping Students to ‘Think with Data’ Using R.” The R Journal, 9(1), 77–102. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024/index.html.\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$syllable_2\nW = 0.95508, p-value = 0.02716\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$syllable_5\nW = 0.95321, p-value = 0.02211\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$study_time_15\nW = 0.9068, p-value = 0.0002348\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$study_time_30\nW = 0.95539, p-value = 0.0281\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$list_length_7\nW = 0.90542, p-value = 0.0002085\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  stm$list_length_15\nW = 0.92806, p-value = 0.001645"

    "text": "4  Setting up R Packages\nLet’s load up a few packages that we need to start:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)   ## data science package collection (incl. the ggplot2 package)\nlibrary(systemfonts) ## use custom fonts (need to be installed on your OS)  \nlibrary(scico)       ## scico color palettes(http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php) in R \nlibrary(ggtext)      ## add improved text rendering to ggplot2\nlibrary(ggforce)     ## add missing functionality to ggplot2\nlibrary(ggdist)      ## add uncertainity visualizations to ggplot2\nlibrary(magick)      ## load images into R\nlibrary(patchwork)   ## combine outputs from ggplot2\nlibrary(kableExtra)  ## Produces attractive tables\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nlibrary(showtext)   ## add google fonts to plots\n\nWe will want to add a few new fonts to our graphs. The best way (currently) is to use the showtext package ( which we loaded above) to bring into our work fonts from Google. To view and select the fonts you might want to work with, spend some time looking over:\n\nGoogle Webfonts Helper App\nGoogle Fonts\n\n\nfont_add_google(\"Gochi Hand\", \"gochi\")\nfont_add_google(\"Schoolbell\", \"bell\")\nfont_add_google(\"Galada\", \"galada\")\nfont_add_google(\"Schoolbell\", \"bell\")\nfont_add_google(\"Roboto\", \"roboto\")\nfont_add_google(\"Noto Sans\", \"noto\")\nfont_add_google(\"Uchen\", \"uchen\")\nfont_add_google(\"Ibarra Real Nova\", \"ibarra\")\nfont_add_google(\"Open Sans\", \"open\")\nfont_add_google(\"Anton\", \"anton\")\nfont_add_google(\"Tangerine\", \"tangerine\")\n\nshowtext_auto() # set the google fonts as default\n\nWe will work with a familiar dataset, so that we can concentrate on the chart aesthetics, without having to spend time getting used to the data: the penguins dataset again, from the palmerpenguins package."

    "text": "8 Using {ggtext}\n\nFrom Claus Wilke’s website (www.wilkelab.org/ggtext)\n\nThe ggtext package provides simple Markdown and HTML rendering for ggplot2. Under the hood, the package uses the gridtext package for the actual rendering, and consequently it is limited to the feature set provided by gridtext.\nSupport is provided for Markdown both in theme elements (plot titles, subtitles, captions, axis labels, legends, etc.) and in geoms (similar to geom_text()). In both cases, there are two alternatives, one for creating simple text labels and one for creating text boxes with word wrapping.\n\nNOTE: on some machines, the ggtext package may not work as expected. In this case, please do as follows, using your Console:\n\nremove gridtext: remove.packages(gridtext).\nInstall development version of gridtext: remotes::install_github(\"wilkelab/gridtext\")\n\n\n\n8.1 element_markdown()\n\nWe can use our familiar markdown syntax right inside the titles and captions of the plot. element_markdown() is a theming command made available by the ggtext package.\nelement_markdown() → formatted text elements, e.g. titles, caption, axis text, strip text\n\n## assign plot to `gt` - we can add new things to this plot later\n## (wrapped in parenthesis so it is assigned and plotted in one step)\n\n(gt <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, \n                            y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    \n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) +\n    \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 3:6 * 10, limits = c(30, 60)) +\n    \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(12.5, 22.5, by = 2.5), \n                     limits = c(12.5, 22.5)) +\n    \n  scico::scale_color_scico(palette = \"bamako\", direction = -1) +\n   \n# New code starts here: Two Step Procedure with ggtext\n# 1. Markdown formatting of labels and title, using asterisks\n# To create italics and bold text in titles\n    \n    \n  labs(\n    title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins (*Pygoscelis*)',\n    subtitle = 'A scatter plot of bill depth versus bill length.',\n    caption = 'Data: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) *PLoS ONE*',\n    \n    x = '**Bill Length** (mm)', \n    y = '**Bill Depth** (mm)',\n    \n    color = 'Body mass (g)'\n  ) +\n   \n  ## 2.

Use html tags to include it, say as part of your plot title, as shown below.\n\n## use HTML syntax to add images to text elements\ngt_mar + \n  labs(title = 'Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"images/culmen_depth.png\"‚ width=\"480\"/>')\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Annotations with geom_richtext() and geom_textbox()\n\nFurther ggplot annotations can be achieved using geom_richtext() and geom_textbox().\ngeom_richtext() also allows formatted text labels with 360° rotation. One needs to pass a dataframe to geom_richtext() giving the location, colour, rotation etc of the label annotation.\n\ngt_rich <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = species), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) + \n  \n  ##

    "text": "9 Using {ggforce}\n\nFrom Thomas Lin Pedersen’s website → www.ggforce.data-imaginist.com\n\nggforce is a package aimed at providing missing functionality to ggplot2 through the extension system introduced with ggplot2 v2.0.0. Broadly speaking ggplot2 has been aimed primarily at explorative data visualization in order to investigate the data at hand, and less at providing utilities for composing custom plots a la D3.js. ggforce is mainly an attempt to address these “shortcoming” (design choices might be a better description). The goal is to provide a repository of geoms, stats, etc. that are as well documented and implemented as the official ones found in ggplot2.\n\nWe will start with the basic plot, with the ggtext related work done up to now:\n\n## use ggtext rendering for the following plots\ntheme_update(\n  plot.title = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  plot.caption = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  axis.title.x = ggtext::element_markdown(),\n  axis.title.y = ggtext::element_markdown()\n)\n\n\n## plot that we will annotate with ggforce afterwards\n(gf <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + \n  scico::scale_color_scico(palette = \"bamako\", direction = -1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(25, 65), ylim = c(10, 25)) +\n  rcartocolor::scale_fill_carto_d(palette = \"Bold\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bill Dimensions of Brush-Tailed Penguins (*Pygoscelis*)\",\n    subtitle = 'A scatter plot of bill depth versus bill length.',\n    caption = \"Data: Gorman, Williams & Fraser (2014) *PLoS ONE*\",\n    x = \"**Bill Length** (mm)\", \n    y = \"**Bill Depth** (mm)\",\n    color = \"Body mass (g)\",\n    fill = \"Species\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n## ellipsoids for all groups\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_ellipse(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species), \n    alpha = .15, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic in this geom was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` in the `default_aes` field and elsewhere instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ellipsoids for specific subset\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_ellipse(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n#   coord_cartesian(xlim = c(25, 65), ylim = c(10, 25))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n## circles\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_circle(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n## rectangles\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_rect(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5) \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(concaveman)\n## hull\n(gf +\n  ggforce::geom_mark_hull(\n    aes(fill = species, label = species, filter = species == 'Gentoo'), \n    alpha = 0, show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = body_mass_g), alpha = .6, size = 3.5)\n)"

OSM data can be downloaded in vector format and used for our own purposes. In this tutorial, we will obtain data from OSM using a query. A query is a request for data from a database.

    "section": "\n2.1 Add Shapes to a Map",
    "text": "2.1 Add Shapes to a Map\nleaflet offers several commands to add points, markers, icons, lines, polylines and polygons to a map. Let us examine a few of these.\n\n2.1.1 Add Markers with popups\n\nm %>% addMarkers(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, \n                 popup = \"The birthplace of Rvind\")\n\n\n\n\n# Click on the Marker for the popup to appear\n\nThis uses the default pin shape as the Marker.\n\n2.1.2 Adding Popups to a Map\nPopups are small boxes containing arbitrary HTML, that point to a specific point on the map. Use the addPopups() function to add standalone popup to the map.\n\nm %>%\n  addPopups(\n    lng = 77.580643,\n    lat = 12.972442,\n    popup = paste(\n      \"The birthplace of Rvind\",\n      \"<br>\",\n      \"Website: https://the-foundation-series.netlify.app\",\n      \"<br>\"\n    ),\n    \n    # Ensuring we cannot close the popup, else we will not be able to find where it is, since there is no Marker\n    options = popupOptions(closeButton = FALSE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPopups are usually added to icons, Markers and other shapes can show up when these are clicked.\n\n2.1.3 Adding Labels to a Map\nLabels are messages attached to all shapes, using the argument label wherever it is available.\nLabels are static, and Popups are usually visible on mouse click. Hence a Marker can have both a label and a popup. For example, the function addPopup() offers only a popup argument, whereas the function addMarkers() offers both a popup and a label argument.\nIt is also possible to create labels standalone using addLabelOnlyMarkers() where we can show only text and no Markers.\n\nm %>%\n  addMarkers(\n    lng = 77.580643,\n    lat = 12.972442,\n    \n    # Here is the Label defn.\n    label = \"The birthplace of Rvind\",\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = TRUE, # Label always visible\n                                textOnly = F, \n                                textsize = 20),\n    \n    # And here is the popup defn.\n    popup = \"This is the Popup Text\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Adding Circles and CircleMarkers on a Map\nWe can add shapes on to a map to depict areas or locations of interest. NOTE: the radius argument works differently in addCircles() and addCircleMarkers().\n\n# Some Cities in the US and their location\nmd_cities <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Baltimore\",\"Frederick\",\"Rockville\",\"Gaithersburg\",\"Bowie\",\"Hagerstown\",\"Annapolis\",\"College Park\",\"Salisbury\",\"Laurel\"),\n  pop = c(619493,66169,62334,61045,55232,39890,38880,30587,30484,25346),\n  lat = c(39.2920592,39.4143921,39.0840,39.1434,39.0068,39.6418,38.9784,38.9897,38.3607,39.0993), \n  lng = c(-76.6077852,-77.4204875,-77.1528,-77.2014,-76.7791,-77.7200,-76.4922,-76.9378,-75.5994,-76.8483)\n)\n\n\nmd_cities %>%\n  leaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  \n  # CircleMarkers, in blue\n  # radius scales the Marker. Units are in Pixels!!\n  # Here, radius is made proportional to `pop` number\n  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~ pop/1000, # Pixels!!\n                   color = \"blue\",\n                   stroke = FALSE, # no border for the Markers\n                   opacity = 0.8) %>% \n  \n  \n  # Circles, in red\n  addCircles(\n    radius = 5000, # Meters !!!\n    stroke = TRUE,\n    color = \"yellow\", # Stroke Colour\n    weight = 3, # Stroke Weight\n    fill = TRUE,\n    fillColor = \"red\",\n\n  )\n\nAssuming \"lng\" and \"lat\" are longitude and latitude, respectively\nAssuming \"lng\" and \"lat\" are longitude and latitude, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shapes need not be of fixed size or colour; their attributes can be made to correspond to other attribute variables in the geospatial data, as we did with radius in the addCircleMarkers() function above.\n\n2.1.5 Adding Rectangles to a Map\n\n## Adding Rectangles\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  addRectangles(lat1 = 10.3858, lng1 = 75.0595, \n                lat2 = 12.8890, lng2 = 77.9625)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Add Polygons to a Map\n\n## Adding Polygons\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  \n  # arbitrary vector data for lat and lng\n   addPolygons(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Add PolyLines to a Map\nThis can be useful say for manually marking a route on a map, with waypoints.\n\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  \n  # arbitrary vector data for lat and lng\n  # If start and end points are the same, it looks like Polygon\n  # Without the fill\n   addPolylines(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7)) %>% \n  \n  # Add Waypoint Icons\n  addMarkers(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7))\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen, we have created Markers, Labels, Polygons, and PolyLines using fixed.i.e. literal text and numbers. In the following we will also see how external geospatial data columns can be used instead of these literals.\nNOTE: The mapedit package https://r-spatial.org//r/2017/01/30/mapedit_intro.html can also be used to interactively add shapes onto a map and save as an geo-spatial object."

    "text": "3.1 Point Data Sources for leaflet\n\nPoint data for markers can come from a variety of sources:\n\n\nSpatialPoints or SpatialPointsDataFrame objects (from the sp package)\n\n\nPOINT, sfc_POINT, and sf objects (from the sf package); only X and Y dimensions will be considered\n\nTwo-column numeric matrices (first column is longitude, second is latitude)\n\n\nData frame/tibble with latitude and longitude columns. You can explicitly tell the marker function which columns contain the coordinate data (e.g. addMarkers(lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude)), or let the function look for columns named lat/latitude and lon/lng/long/longitude (case insensitive).\n\nSimply provide numeric vectors as lng and lat arguments, which we have covered already in the preceding sections.\n\nNote that MULTIPOINT objects from sf are not supported at this time.\nWe will not consider the use of sp related data structures for plotting POINTs in leaflet since sp is being phased out in favour of the more modern package sf.\n\n3.1.1 Points using simple Data Frames\nLet us read in the data set from data.world that gives us POINT locations of all airports in India in a data frame / tibble. The dataset is available at https://query.data.world/s/ahtyvnm2ybylf65syp4rsb5tulxe6a. You can either download it, save a copy, and read it in as usual, or use the URL itself to read it in from the web. In the latter case, you will need the package data.world and also need to register your credentials for that page with RStudio. The (simple!) instructions are available here at data.world.\n\n#library(devtools)\n#devtools::install_github(\"datadotworld/data.world-r\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\nlibrary(data.world)\n\nLoading required package: dwapi\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dwapi'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    sql\n\nindia_airports <-\n  read_csv(\"https://query.data.world/s/ahtyvnm2ybylf65syp4rsb5tulxe6a\") %>% \n  slice(-1) %>% # Drop the first row which contains labels\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    id = as.integer(id),\n    latitude_deg = as.numeric(latitude_deg),\n    longitude_deg = as.numeric(longitude_deg),\n    elevation_ft = as.integer(elevation_ft)\n  ) %>% \n  rename(\"lon\" = longitude_deg, \"lat\" = latitude_deg) %>% \n  # Remove four locations which seem to be in the African Atlantic\n  filter(!id %in% c(330834, 330867, 325010, 331083))\n\nRows: 345 Columns: 20\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (20): id, ident, type, name, latitude_deg, longitude_deg, elevation_ft, ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nindia_airports %>% head()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet us plot this in leaflet, using an ESRI National Geographic style map instead of the OSM Base Map.

This differs from the earlier situation where we had a simple data frame with lon and lat columns. In sf, the lon and lat info is embedded in the geometry column of the sf data frame.\nThe tmap package has a data set of all World metro cities, titled metro. We will plot these on the map and also scale the markers in proportion to one of the feature attributes, pop2030. The popup will be the name of the metro city. We will also use the CartoDB.Positron base map.\nNote that the metro data set has a POINT geometry, as needed!\n\ndata(metro, package = \"tmap\")\nmetro\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nleaflet(data = metro) %>% \n  setView(lat = 18, lng = 77, zoom = 4) %>% \n  \n  # Add CartoDB.Positron\n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% # CartoDB Basemap\n  \n  # Add Markers for each airport\n  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~ sqrt(pop2030)/350,\n                   color = \"red\",\n                   popup = paste(\"Name: \", metro$name, \"<br>\",\n                                  \"Population 2030: \", metro$pop2030))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also try downloading an sf data frame with POINT geometry from say OSM data<https://osm.

Despite this some fontawesome icons simply do not seem to show up. ;-()\n\nlibrary(fontawesome)\ncoffee <- makeAwesomeIcon(\n  text = fa(\"mug-hot\"), # mug-hot was introduced in fa version 5\n  iconColor = \"black\",\n  markerColor = \"blue\",\n  library = \"fa\"\n)\n\n\nleaflet(data = locations) %>% \n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Voyager) %>% \n  \n  # Workaround code\n\n  addAwesomeMarkers(icon = coffee,\n             popup = paste(\"Name: \", locations$name,\"<br>\",\n                           \"Food: \", locations$cuisine, \"<br>\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that leaflet automatically detects the lon/lat columns from within the POINT geometry column of the sf data frame.\n\n3.1.3 Points using Two-Column Matrices\nWe can now quickly try providing lon and lat info in a two column matrix.This can be useful to plot a bunch of points recorded on a mobile phone app.\n\nmysore5 <- matrix(c(runif(5, 76.652985-0.01, 76.652985+0.01),\n                 runif(5, 12.311827-0.01, 12.311827+0.01)),\n                 nrow = 5)\nmysore5\n\n         [,1]     [,2]\n[1,] 76.65387 12.31681\n[2,] 76.66260 12.31176\n[3,] 76.65750 12.31252\n[4,] 76.65581 12.30970\n[5,] 76.64777 12.31510\n\nleaflet(data = mysore5) %>% \n  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap) %>% \n  \n# Pick an icon from <https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_comp_glyphs.asp>\n  addAwesomeMarkers(icon = awesomeIcons(\n  icon = 'music',\n  iconColor = 'black',\n  library = 'glyphicon'),\n  popup = \"Carnatic Music !!\")"

    "text": "2.1 Add Shapes to a Map\nleaflet offers several commands to add points, markers, icons, lines, polylines and polygons to a map. Let us examine a few of these.\n\n2.1.1 Add Markers with popups\n\nm %>% addMarkers(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, \n                 popup = \"The birthplace of Rvind\")\n\n\n\n\n# Click on the Marker for the popup to appear\n\nThis uses the default pin shape as the Marker.\n\n2.1.2 Adding Popups to a Map\nPopups are small boxes containing arbitrary HTML, that point to a specific point on the map. Use the addPopups() function to add standalone popup to the map.\n\nm %>%\n  addPopups(\n    lng = 77.580643,\n    lat = 12.972442,\n    popup = paste(\n      \"The birthplace of Rvind\",\n      \"<br>\",\n      \"Website: https://the-foundation-series.netlify.app\",\n      \"<br>\"\n    ),\n    \n    # Ensuring we cannot close the popup, else we will not be able to find where it is, since there is no Marker\n    options = popupOptions(closeButton = FALSE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPopups are usually added to icons, Markers and other shapes can show up when these are clicked.\n\n2.1.3 Adding Labels to a Map\nLabels are messages attached to all shapes, using the argument label wherever it is available.\nLabels are static, and Popups are usually visible on mouse click. Hence a Marker can have both a label and a popup. For example, the function addPopup() offers only a popup argument, whereas the function addMarkers() offers both a popup and a label argument.\nIt is also possible to create labels standalone using addLabelOnlyMarkers() where we can show only text and no Markers.\n\nm %>%\n  addMarkers(\n    lng = 77.580643,\n    lat = 12.972442,\n    \n    # Here is the Label defn.\n    label = \"The birthplace of Rvind\",\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = TRUE, # Label always visible\n                                textOnly = F, \n                                textsize = 20),\n    \n    # And here is the popup defn.\n    popup = \"This is the Popup Text\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Adding Circles and CircleMarkers on a Map\nWe can add shapes on to a map to depict areas or locations of interest. NOTE: the radius argument works differently in addCircles() and addCircleMarkers().\n\n# Some Cities in the US and their location\nmd_cities <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Baltimore\",\"Frederick\",\"Rockville\",\"Gaithersburg\",\"Bowie\",\"Hagerstown\",\"Annapolis\",\"College Park\",\"Salisbury\",\"Laurel\"),\n  pop = c(619493,66169,62334,61045,55232,39890,38880,30587,30484,25346),\n  lat = c(39.2920592,39.4143921,39.0840,39.1434,39.0068,39.6418,38.9784,38.9897,38.3607,39.0993), \n  lng = c(-76.6077852,-77.4204875,-77.1528,-77.2014,-76.7791,-77.7200,-76.4922,-76.9378,-75.5994,-76.8483)\n)\n\n\nmd_cities %>%\n  leaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  \n  # CircleMarkers, in blue\n  # radius scales the Marker. Units are in Pixels!!\n  # Here, radius is made proportional to `pop` number\n  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~ pop/1000, # Pixels!!\n                   color = \"blue\",\n                   stroke = FALSE, # no border for the Markers\n                   opacity = 0.8) %>% \n  \n  \n  # Circles, in red\n  addCircles(\n    radius = 5000, # Meters !!!\n    stroke = TRUE,\n    color = \"yellow\", # Stroke Colour\n    weight = 3, # Stroke Weight\n    fill = TRUE,\n    fillColor = \"red\",\n\n  )\n\nAssuming \"lng\" and \"lat\" are longitude and latitude, respectively\nAssuming \"lng\" and \"lat\" are longitude and latitude, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shapes need not be of fixed size or colour; their attributes can be made to correspond to other attribute variables in the geospatial data, as we did with radius in the addCircleMarkers() function above.\n\n2.1.5 Adding Rectangles to a Map\n\n## Adding Rectangles\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  addRectangles(lat1 = 10.3858, lng1 = 75.0595, \n                lat2 = 12.8890, lng2 = 77.9625)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Add Polygons to a Map\n\n## Adding Polygons\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  \n  # arbitrary vector data for lat and lng\n   addPolygons(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Add PolyLines to a Map\nThis can be useful say for manually marking a route on a map, with waypoints.\n\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%\n  setView(lng = 77.580643, lat = 12.972442, zoom = 6) %>% \n  \n  # arbitrary vector data for lat and lng\n  # If start and end points are the same, it looks like Polygon\n  # Without the fill\n   addPolylines(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7)) %>% \n  \n  # Add Waypoint Icons\n  addMarkers(lng = c(73.5, 75.9, 76.1, 77.23, 79.8),\n               lat =c(10.12, 11.04, 11.87, 12.04, 10.7))\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen, we have created Markers, Labels, Polygons, and PolyLines using fixed.i.e. literal text and numbers. In the following we will also see how external geospatial data columns can be used instead of these literals.\nNOTE: The mapedit package https://r-spatial.org//r/2017/01/30/mapedit_intro.html can also be used to interactively add shapes onto a map and save as an geo-spatial object."

We will also use the CartoDB.Positron base map.\nNote that the metro data set has a POINT geometry, as needed!\n\ndata(metro, package = \"tmap\")\nmetro\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nleaflet(data = metro) %>% \n  setView(lat = 18, lng = 77, zoom = 4) %>% \n  \n  # Add CartoDB.Positron\n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% # CartoDB Basemap\n  \n  # Add Markers for each airport\n  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~ sqrt(pop2030)/350,\n                   color = \"red\",\n                   popup = paste(\"Name: \", metro$name, \"<br>\",\n                                  \"Population 2030: \", metro$pop2030))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also try downloading an sf data frame with POINT geometry from say OSM data<https://osm.

    "section": "\n5 Graph Metaphors",
    "text": "5 Graph Metaphors\nNetwork graphs are characterized by two key terms: nodes and edges\n\n\nNodes : Entities\n\nMetaphors: Individual People? Things? Ideas? Places? to be connected in the network.\nSynonyms: vertices. Nodes have IDs.\n\n\n\nEdges: Connections\n\nMetaphors: Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Letters sent and received? Dependence? between the entities.\nSynonyms: links, ties.\n\n\n\nIn R, we create network representations using node and edge information. One way in which these could be organized are:\n\n\nNode list: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs found in the edge list. You can also add attribute columns to the data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables. ( Type? Class? Family? Country? Subject? Race? )\n\n\nNode Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nNode Name\nAttribute? Qualities?Categories? Family? Country?Planet?\n\n\n1\nNed\nNursery School Teacher\n\n\n2\nJaguar Paw\nMain Character, Apocalypto\n\n\n3\nJohn Snow\nEpidemiologist\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge list: data frame containing two columns: source node and destination node of an edge. Source and Destination have node IDs.\n\nWeighted network graph: An edge list can also contain additional columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered weighted.\n\n\nEdges Table\n\nFrom\nTo\nRelationship\nWeightage\n\n\n\n1\n3\nFinancial Dealings\n6\n\n\n2\n1\nHistory Lessons\n2\n\n\n2\n3\nVaccination\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nLayout: A geometric arrangement of nodes and edges.\n\nMetaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour? Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the arrangement.\n\n\n\nLayout Algorithms : Method to arranges nodes and edges with the aim of optimizing some metric .\n\nMetaphors: Nodes are masses and edges are springs. The Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all springs.(BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all springs?…)\n\n\nDirected and undirected network graph: If the distinction between source and target is meaningful, the network is directed. If the distinction is not meaningful, the network is undirected. Directed edges represent an ordering of nodes, like a relationship extending from one node to another, where switching the direction would change the structure of the network. Undirected edges are simply links between nodes where order does not matter.\n\nExamples:\n - The World Wide Web is an example of a directed network because\n hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily \n the other way around.\n\n - Co-authorship networks represent examples of un-directed networks,\nwhere nodes are authors and they are connected by an edge if they\nhave written a publication together\n\n - When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the\nsender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful,\ntherefore the network is directed.\n\n\nConnected and Disconnected graphs: If there is some path from any node to any other node, the Networks is said to be Connected. Else, Disconnected."

Let us try using aes() inside each geom to map a variable to a geometric aspect.\nDon’t try to use more than 2 aesthetic mappings simultaneously!!\nThe node elements we can tweak are:\n\nTypes of Nodes: geom_node_****()\n\nNode Parameters: inside geom_node_****(aes(...............))\n-aes(alpha  = node-variable) : opacity; a value between 0 and 1\n-aes(shape  = node-variable) : node shape\n-aes(colour = node-variable) : node colour\n-aes(fill   = node-variable) : fill colour for node\n-aes(size   = node-variable) : size of node\n\nThe edge elements we can tweak are:\n\nType of Edges” geom_edge_****()\n\nEdge Parameters: inside geom_edge_****(aes(...............))\n-aes(colour = edge-variable) : colour of the edge\n-aes(width  = edge-variable) : width of the edge\n-aes(label  = some_variable) : labels for the edge\n\nType ?geom_node_point and ?geom-edge_link in your Console for more information.\n\nggraph(graph = ga, layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + # change variable here\n  \n  geom_node_point(aes(color = race), size = 6) + # change variable here\n\n\n  labs(title = \"Whoo Hoo! Yet another Grey's Anatomy graph in R!\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Inferences #5:\n\n\nQuestions and Inferences: Describe some of the changes here. What types of edges worked? Which variables were you able to use for nodes and edges and how? What did not work with either of the two?"

Make graphs wiggle and shake using tidy commands! The package implements interactivity using the physical metaphor of weights and springs we discussed earlier.\nThe visNetwork() function uses a nodes list and edges list to create an interactive graph.

Groups of 4. To be announced\nYou need to create a Network Graph for your favourite Book, play, TV serial or Show. (E.g. Friends, BBT, or LB or HIMYM, B99, TGP, JTV…or Hamlet, Little Women , Pride and Prejudice, or LoTR)\nStep 1. Go to: Literary Networks for instructions.\nStep 2. Make your data using the instructions.\n\nIn the nodes excel, use id and names as your columns. Any other details in other columns to the right.\nIn your edges excel, use from and to are your first columns. Entries in these columns can be names or ids but be consistent and don’t mix.\n\nStep 3. Decide on 3 answers that you to seek and plan to make graphs for.\nStep 4. Create graph objects. Say 3 visualizations.\nStep 5. Write comments/answers in the code and narrative text. Add pictures from the web using Markdown syntax.\nStep 6. Write Reflection ( ok, a short one!) inside your Quarto document. Make sure it renders !!\nStep 7. Group Submission: Submit the render-able .qmd file AND the data. Quarto Markdown with joint authorship. Each person submits on their Assignments. All get the same grade on this one.\nAsk me for clarifications on what to do after you have read the Instructions in your group."

Let’s fetch a figure from the web to show the (preferred) structure of data in R.\n\n\nTidy Data\n\n\nThe three features described in the figure above define the nature of tidy data:\n\nVariables in Columns\n\nObservations in Rows and\n\nMeasurements in Cells.\n\nData are imagined to be resulting from an experiment. Each variable represents a parameter/aspect in the experiment. Each row represents an additional datum of measurement. A cell is a single measurement on a single parameter(column) in a single observation(row).\nWhen working with data you must:\n\nFigure out what you want to do. (Purpose)\nDescribe those tasks in the form of a computer program. (Plain English to R Code)\nExecute the program.\n\nThe dplyr package makes these steps fast and easy:\n\nBy constraining your options, it helps you think about your data manipulation challenges.\nIt provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code.\nIt uses efficient backends, so you spend less time waiting for the computer.\n\n\nNe’er you mind about backends ;-) See Shakespeare’s Hamlet.\n\nThis document introduces you to dplyr’s basic set of tools, and shows you how to apply them to data frames. dplyr also supports databases via the dbplyr package, once you’ve installed, read vignette(\"dbplyr\") to learn more."

    "section": "\n5 Single table verbs",
    "text": "5 Single table verbs\ndplyr aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These verbs can be organised into three categories based on the component of the dataset that they work with:\n\nRows:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\nslice() chooses rows based on location.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\n\nColumns:\n\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate() changes the values of columns and creates new columns.\n\nrelocate() changes the order of the columns.\n\n\nGroups of rows:\n\n\nsummarise() collapses a group into a single row.\n\n\n\n\nThink of the parallels from Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n5.1 The pipe\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame (or tibble) as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the %>% operator from magrittr. x %>% f(y) turns into f(x, y) so the result from one step is then “piped” into the next step. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (reading the pipe operator as “then”).\n\n5.2 Filter rows with filter()\n\nfilter() allows you to select a subset of rows in a data frame. Like all single verbs, the first argument is the tibble (or data frame). The second and subsequent arguments refer to variables within that data frame, selecting rows where the expression is TRUE.\nFor example, we can select all character with light skin color and brown eyes with:\n\nNote the double equal to sign (==) below! Equivalent to MS Excel Data -> Filter\n\n\nstarwars %>% filter(skin_color == \"light\", eye_color == \"brown\")\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.3 Arrange rows with arrange()\n\narrange() works similarly to filter() except that instead of filtering or selecting rows, it reorders them. It takes a data frame, and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:\n\nstarwars %>% arrange(height, mass)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUse desc() to order a column in descending order:\n\nstarwars %>% arrange(desc(height))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.4 Choose rows using their position with slice()\n\nslice() lets you index rows by their (integer) locations. It allows you to select, remove, and duplicate rows.\n\nThis is an important step in Prediction, Modelling and Machine Learning.\n\nWe can get characters from row numbers 5 through 10.\n\nstarwars %>% slice(5:10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt is accompanied by a number of helpers for common use cases:\n\n\nslice_head() and slice_tail() select the first or last rows.\n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_head(n = 3)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nslice_sample() randomly selects rows. Use the option prop to choose a certain proportion of the cases.\n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nstarwars %>% slice_sample(prop = 0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nUse replace = TRUE to perform a bootstrap sample. If needed, you can weight the sample with the weight argument.\n\nBootstrap samples are a special statistical sampling method. Counterintuitive perhaps, since you sample with replacement. Should remind you of your high school Permutation and Combination class, with all those urn models and so on. If you remember.\n\n\n\nslice_min() and slice_max() select rows with highest or lowest values of a variable. Note that we first must choose only the values which are not NA.\n\n\nstarwars %>%\n  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%\n  slice_min(height, n = 3)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.5 Select columns with select()\n\nOften you work with large datasets with many columns but only a few are actually of interest to you. select() allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations that usually only work on numeric variable positions:\n\n# Select columns by name\nstarwars %>% select(hair_color, skin_color, eye_color)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns between hair_color and eye_color (inclusive)\nstarwars %>% select(hair_color:eye_color)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns except those from hair_color to eye_color (inclusive)\nstarwars %>% select(!(hair_color:eye_color))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Select all columns ending with color\nstarwars %>% select(ends_with(\"color\"))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThere are a number of helper functions you can use within select(), like starts_with(), ends_with(), matches() and contains(). These let you quickly match larger blocks of variables that meet some criterion. See ?select for more details.\nYou can rename variables with select() by using named arguments:\n\nstarwars %>% select(home_world = homeworld)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBut because select() drops all the variables not explicitly mentioned, it’s not that useful. Instead, use rename():\n\nstarwars %>% rename(home_world = homeworld)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.6 Add new columns with mutate()\n\nBesides selecting sets of existing columns, it’s often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. This is the job of mutate():\n\nstarwars %>% mutate(height_m = height / 100)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can’t see the height in meters we just calculated, but we can fix that using a select command.\n\nstarwars %>%\n  mutate(height_m = height / 100) %>%\n  select(height_m, height, everything())\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\ndplyr::mutate() is similar to the base transform(), but allows you to refer to columns that you’ve just created:\n\nstarwars %>%\n  mutate(\n    height_m = height / 100,\n    BMI = mass / (height_m^2)\n  ) %>%\n  select(BMI, everything())\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute():\n\nstarwars %>%\n  transmute(\n    height_m = height / 100,\n    BMI = mass / (height_m^2)\n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.7 Change column order with relocate()\n\nUse a similar syntax as select() to move blocks of columns at once\n\nstarwars %>% relocate(sex:homeworld, .before = height)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.8 Summarise values with summarise()\n\nThe last verb is summarise(). It collapses a data frame to a single row.\n\nstarwars %>% summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIt’s not that useful until we learn the group_by() verb below.\n\n5.9 Commonalities\nYou may have noticed that the syntax and function of all these verbs are very similar:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame.\nThe subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using $.\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nTogether these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result.\nThese five functions provide the basis of a language of data manipulation. At the most basic level, you can only alter a tidy data frame in five useful ways: you can reorder the rows (arrange()), pick observations and variables of interest (filter() and select()), add new variables that are functions of existing variables (mutate()), or collapse many values to a summary (summarise())."

This doesn’t lead to particularly elegant code, especially if you want to do many operations at once.

    "title": "Introduction to the dplyr package",
    "section": "\n7 Patterns of operations",
    "text": "7 Patterns of operations\nThe dplyr verbs can be classified by the type of operations they accomplish (we sometimes speak of their semantics, i.e., their meaning). It’s helpful to have a good grasp of the difference between select and mutate operations.\n\n7.1 Selecting operations\nOne of the appealing features of dplyr is that you can refer to columns from the tibble as if they were regular variables. However, the syntactic uniformity of referring to bare column names hides semantical differences across the verbs. A column symbol supplied to select() does not have the same meaning as the same symbol supplied to mutate().\nSelecting operations expect column names and positions. Hence, when you call select() with bare variable names, they actually represent their own positions in the tibble. The following calls are completely equivalent from dplyr’s point of view:\n\n# `name` represents the integer 1\nselect(starwars, name)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nselect(starwars, 1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBy the same token, this means that you cannot refer to variables from the surrounding context if they have the same name as one of the columns. In the following example, height still represents 2, not 5:\n\nheight <- 5\nselect(starwars, height)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOne useful subtlety is that this only applies to bare names and to selecting calls like c(height, mass) or height:mass. In all other cases, the columns of the data frame are not put in scope. This allows you to refer to contextual variables in selection helpers:\n\nname <- \"color\"\nselect(starwars, ends_with(name))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThese semantics are usually intuitive. But note the subtle difference:\n\nname <- 5\nselect(starwars, name, identity(name))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the first argument, name represents its own position 1. In the second argument, name is evaluated in the surrounding context and represents the fifth column.\n\n7.2 Mutating operations\nMutate semantics are quite different from selection semantics. Whereas select() expects column names or positions, mutate() expects column vectors. We will set up a smaller tibble to use for our examples.\n\ndf <- starwars %>% select(name, height, mass)\n\nWhen we use select(), the bare column names stand for their own positions in the tibble. For mutate() on the other hand, column symbols represent the actual column vectors stored in the tibble. Consider what happens if we give a string or a number to mutate():\n\nmutate(df, \"height\", 2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nmutate() gets length-1 vectors that it interprets as new columns in the data frame. These vectors are recycled so they match the number of rows. That’s why it doesn’t make sense to supply expressions like \"height\" + 10 to mutate(). This amounts to adding 10 to a string! The correct expression is:\n\nmutate(df, height + 10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the same way, you can unquote values from the context if these values represent a valid column. They must be either length 1 (they then get recycled) or have the same length as the number of rows. In the following example we create a new vector that we add to the data frame:\n\nvar <- seq(1, nrow(df))\nmutate(df, new = var)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nA case in point is group_by(). While you might think it has select semantics, it actually has mutate semantics. This is quite handy as it allows to group by a modified column:\n\ngroup_by(starwars, sex)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngroup_by(starwars, sex = as.factor(sex))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\ngroup_by(starwars, height_binned = cut(height, 3))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is why you can’t supply a column name to group_by(). This amounts to creating a new column containing the string recycled to the number of rows:\n\ngroup_by(df, \"month\")"

    "text": "13 How many artists of each gender are there?\nThis is a harder question to answer than you think! This is because the level of observation in our current moma dataset is unique paintings. We have multiple paintings done by the same artists though, so counting just the number of unique paintings is different than counting the number of unique artists.\nRemember how count can be used back-to-back to roll up a level of detail? Try running count(artist_gender) again on your last code chunk.\n\nmoma %>% \n  count(artist_gender, artist) %>% \n  count(artist_gender)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis output takes the previous table (made with count(artist_gender, artist)), and essentially ignores the n column. So we no longer care about how many paintings each individual artist created. Instead, we want to count the rows in this new table where each row is a unique artist. By counting by artist_gender in the last line, we are grouping by levels of that variable (so Female/Male/NA) and nn is the number of unique artists for each gender category recorded."

    "text": "History\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrier Seated\n\n\n\n\nThe Boston terrier breed originated around 1875, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston purchased from Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper’s Judge), which was of a bull and terrier type lineage. Hooper’s Judge is directly related to the original bull and terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper’s Judge as the ancestor of all true modern Boston Terriers. Judge weighed about 32 pounds (15 kg).\n\n\n\n\nJudge was bred to Burnett’s Gyp (or Kate). Gyp was a white bulldog-type female, owned by Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts. She weighed about 20 pounds (9.1 kg), was stocky and strong and had the typical blocky head now shown in Bostons. From this foundation of the breed, subsequent breeders refined the breed into its modern day presentation. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the bull and terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg) (Old Boston Bulldogs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA young male Boston Terrier with a Brown brindle coat\n\nThe breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed’s nickname, “roundheads”. Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog breed in the US.\nIn the early years, the color and markings were not very important to the breed’s standard. By the 20th century the breed’s distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. Boston University has used Rhett the Boston Terrier as their mascot since 1922. Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC has had a live Boston Terrier mascot named Blitz since 2003 that attends home football games. The Boston Terrier has also been the official state dog of Massachusetts since 1979."

    "text": "Description\nThe Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the tail is short. According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25 pounds (11 kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15–17 inches (380–430 mm) at the withers.\nThe American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds.\nCoat and color\nThe Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal (color of a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the bright sun), or a combination of the three. Any other color is not accepted as a Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually obtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its characteristic “tuxedo” appearance.6 Any Boston Terrier from AKC parentage regardless of the color, or if it is a splash or has a blue eye or weak ears, can be and are registered by the AKC and participate in any AKC sporting events.\n\n\n\nA female Boston Terrier with a black coat\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the Boston Terrier’s markings are broken down into two categories: Required, which consists of a white chest, white muzzle band, and a white band between the eyes; and Desired, which includes the Required markings plus a white collar, white on the forelegs, forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier’s markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as “the American Gentleman.”\n\n\n\nAn adult male Boston Terrier with a black coat"

    "text": "Temperament\nBoston Terrier is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humor. Boston Terriers are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.\nWhile originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment factories, they were later bred for companionship. They are not considered terriers by the American Kennel Club, however, but are part of the non-sporting group.\nBoth females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary, Their usually sensible attitude toward barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets, if properly socialized."

    "section": "Grooming",
    "text": "Grooming\nWith a short, shiny, smooth coat, Boston Terriers require little grooming. Bostons produce light shedding, and weekly brushing of their fine coat is effective at removing loose hair. Brushing promotes the health of the coat because it distributes skin oils, and it also encourages new hair growth. Occasional bathing is suitable for the breed.7\nThe nails of Boston Terriers require regular trimming. Overgrown nails not only have the potential to inflict pain on the breed, but they can also make walking difficult or tear off after getting snagged on something.\nSimilarly to nail trimming, tooth brushing should also be done regularly to promote good oral health. The risk of the breed developing oral pain, gum infection, or bad breath can be decreased with regular tooth brushing that removes plaque buildup and other bacteria. In addition, poor dental hygiene can lead to tooth root abscesses that can lead to damage around the tissue and eventually lead to the loss of teeth."

However, there is still a decent amount of overlapping data.\n\npenguin_plot <- smaller %>% \n  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, fill = sex)) + \n  geom_density(color = \"white\", alpha = 0.5) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Penguin Bins\")\n\npenguin_plot\n\n\n\n\nLastly we can fit a basic linear model comparing body weight in grams to the flipper length of the penguins by specific species. There is a strong linear relationship, although it’s a bit difficult to distinguish between Chinstrap and Adelie penguins.\n\npenguin_size_plot <- penguins_clean %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\",\"cyan4\")) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Mass (g)\", y = \"Flipper Length (mm)\") +\n  geom_smooth(aes(group = \"none\"), method = \"lm\")\n\npenguin_size_plot\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can save the overall distribution and the linear model plot.\n\nggsave(\"penguin-dist.png\", penguin_plot, \n  dpi = \"retina\", height = 8, width = 8)\n\nggsave(\"penguin-smooth.png\", penguin_size_plot, \n  dpi = \"retina\", height = 8, width = 8)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nModeling section\nMoving on to some basic modeling we can see if what kind of relationships we observe in the data. Note that I’m really not following any plan, just indicating how you can fit some different models all at once with dplyr + broom.\n\nmodel_inputs <- tibble(\n  model_form = c(\n    list(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g),\n    list(species_num ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex),\n    list(flipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species)\n    ),\n  data = list(penguins_clean)\n) \n\nmodel_metrics <- model_inputs %>% \n  rowwise(model_form, data) %>% \n  summarize(lm = list(lm(model_form, data = data)), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  rowwise(model_form, lm, data) %>% \n  summarise(broom::glance(lm), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nWrap up\nWe can then take the model outcomes and throw them into a quick gt table.\n\nmodel_metrics %>% \n  select(model_form, r.squared:p.value) %>% \n  mutate(model_form = as.character(model_form)) %>% \n  gt::gt() %>% \n  gt::fmt_number(r.squared:statistic) %>% \n  gt::fmt_scientific(p.value) %>% \n  gt::cols_width(\n    model_form ~ px(150)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_form\n      r.squared\n      adj.r.squared\n      sigma\n      statistic\n      p.value\n    \n\n\nflipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g\n0.76\n0.76\n6.85\n1,060.30\n3.13 × 10−105\n\n\n\nspecies_num ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex\n0.84\n0.84\n0.36\n583.59\n2.45 × 10−131\n\n\n\nflipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species\n0.83\n0.83\n5.83\n529.22\n1.66 × 10−125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this was a quick overview of the beauty of literate programming. We have R code that is self-documenting, as we capture our thoughts and the outputs in a single document. We know at some level that the code works since it “logs” the outputs at various stages and could still output to additional log files. To render it has to run successfully in a linear fashion, and it is human readable as code, via the visual editor or even in version control like Git!"

Age was not significantly associated with tumor response (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00, 1.04; p=0.091). If you’re printing results from a categorical variable, include the level argument, e.g. inline_text(tbl_m1, variable = stage, level = \"T3\") resolves to “0.94 (95% CI 0.39, 2.28; p=0.9)”.\n\nThe inline_text function has arguments for rounding the p-value (pvalue_fun) and the coefficients and confidence interval (estimate_fun). These default to the same rounding performed in the table, but can be modified when reporting inline.\nFor more details about inline code, review to the RStudio documentation page."

    "text": "The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. This style has been implemented in LaTeX and HTML/CSS1, respectively. We have ported both implementations into the tufte package. If you want LaTeX/PDF output, you may use the tufte_handout format for handouts, and tufte_book for books. For HTML output, use tufte_html. These formats can be either specified in the YAML metadata at the beginning of an R Markdown document (see an example below), or passed to the rmarkdown::render() function. See Allaire et al. (2022) for more information about rmarkdown.1 See Github repositories tufte-latex and tufte-css\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\noutput:\n  tufte::tufte_handout: default\n  tufte::tufte_html: default\n---\nThere are two goals of this package:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same R Markdown document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures, e.g. when you want a margin figure, all you need to do is the chunk option fig.margin = TRUE, and we will take care of the details for you, so you never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} \\end{marginfigure} or <span class=\"marginfigure\"> </span>; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.\n\nIf you have any feature requests or find bugs in tufte, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/rstudio/tufte/issues. For general questions, you may ask them on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/rmarkdown."

You can adjust the proportions of figures using the fig.width and fig.height chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin."

    "text": "Arbitrary Margin Content\nIn fact, you can include anything in the margin using the knitr engine named marginfigure. Unlike R code chunks ```{r}, you write a chunk starting with ```{marginfigure} instead, then put the content in the chunk. See an example on the right about the first fundamental theorem of calculus.\n\nWe know from _the first fundamental theorem of calculus_ that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{a}^{x} f(u)\\,du\\right)=f(x).$$\n\nFor the sake of portability between LaTeX and HTML, you should keep the margin content as simple as possible (syntax-wise) in the marginefigure blocks. You may use simple Markdown syntax like **bold** and _italic_ text, but please refrain from using footnotes, citations, or block-level elements (e.g. blockquotes and lists) there.\nNote: if you set echo = FALSE in your global chunk options, you will have to add echo = TRUE to the chunk to display a margin figure, for example ```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}."

meaning of the colors we used:\n\nplot(net)\nlegend(x = -2.1, y = -1.1, \n       c(\"Newspaper\",\"Television\", \"Online News\"), \n       pch = 21,col = \"#777777\", \n       pt.bg = colrs, pt.cex = 2.5, bty = \"n\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n# legends are automatic with the tidygraph + ggraph flow\n\nSometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in plotting only the labels of the nodes:\n\nplot(net, vertex.shape = \"none\", vertex.label = V(net)$media,\n     vertex.label.font = 2, vertex.label.color = \"gray40\",\n     vertex.label.cex = .7, edge.color =

circle(0.5, \"cm\")) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(label = media))\n\n\n\n\nLet’s color the edges of the graph based on their source node color. We’ll get the starting node for each edge with ends().\nNote: Edge attribute is being set by start node.\n\nedge.start <- ends(net, es = E(net), names = F)[,1]\nedge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start] # How simple this is !!!\n# The three colors are recycled \n# \nplot(net, edge.color = edge.col, edge.curved = .4)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The source node colour has been set using the media.type, which is a node attribute. Node attributes are not typically accessible to edges. So we need to build a combo data frame using dplyr, so that edges can use this node attribute. ( There may be other ways…)\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# Make a \"combo\" data frame of nodes *and* edges with left_join()\n# Join by `from` so that type.label is based on from = edge.start\n\nlinks %>%\n  left_join(., nodes, by = c(\"from\" = \"id\")) %>%\n  tbl_graph(edges = ., nodes = nodes) %>%\n  \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>%\n  \n  ggraph(., layout = \"lgl\") +\n  geom_edge_arc(aes(color = type.label,\n                    width = weight),\n                strength = 0.3)  +\n  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type.label,\n                      # type.label is now available as edge attribute\n                      size = size),\n                  shape = 21,\n                  color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Media Type\",\n    values = c(\"grey50\", \"gold\", \"tomato\"),\n    guide = \"legend\"\n  ) +\n  scale_edge_color_manual(name = \"Source Type\",\n                          values = c(\"grey80\", \"gold\", \"tomato\")) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 1.5), guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(\"Degree\", range =  c(2, 16)) +\n  # not \"limits\"!\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(pch = 21,\n                                                 size = 4)))"

You can change that with the parameter rescale = FALSE and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar. You can use norm_coords to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want. This way you can create more compact or spread out layout versions.\n\n#Get the layout coordinates:\nl <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)\n# Normalize them so that they are in the -1, 1 interval:\nl <- norm_coords(l, ymin = -1, ymax = 1, xmin = -1, xmax = 1)\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(0,0,0,0))\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.4)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*0.8)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.2)\nplot(net.bg, rescale = F, layout = l*1.6)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# Can't do this with tidygraph ( multiplying layout * scalar ), it seems\n\nAnother popular force-directed algorithm that produces nice results for connected graphs is Kamada Kawai.

More similar/less distant nodes are placed closer to each other. By default, the measure used is based on the shortest paths between nodes in the network. That can be changed with the dist parameter.\n\nplot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_mds)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)\ngraph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_mds(.)) + \n  geom_edge_link0(colour = \"grey\") + \n  geom_node_point(colour = \"orange\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nThe LGL algorithm is for large connected graphs. Here you can specify a root- the node that will be placed in the middle of the layout.\n\nplot(net.bg, layout = layout_with_lgl)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\n# graph <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 100, power = 1.2)\ngraph %>% ggraph(., layout = layout_with_lgl(.)) + \n  geom_edge_link0(colour = \"grey\") + \n  geom_node_point(colour = \"orange\", size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nBy default, igraph uses a layout called layout_nicely which selects an appropriate layout algorithm based on the properties of the graph.

    "text": "5. Plotting multiplex networks\nIn some cases, the networks we want to plot are multigraphs: they can have multiple edges connecting the same two nodes. A related concept, multiplex networks, contain multiple types of ties – e.g. friendship, romantic, and work relationships between individuals.\nIn our example network, we also have two tie types: hyperlinks and mentions. One thing we can do is plot each type of tie separately:\n\nE(net)$width <- 2\nplot(\n  net,\n  edge.color = c(\"dark red\", \"slategrey\")[(E(net)$type == \"hyperlink\") +\n                                            1],\n  vertex.color = \"gray40\",\n  layout = layout_in_circle,\n  edge.curved = .3\n)\n\n\n\n# Another way to delete edges using the minus operator:\nnet.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == \"hyperlink\"]\nnet.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type == \"mention\"]\n\n#Plot the two links separately:\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nplot(net.h,\n     vertex.color = \"orange\",\n     layout = layout_with_fr,\n     main = \"Tie: Hyperlink\")\nplot(net.m,\n     vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue2\",\n     layout = layout_with_fr,\n     main = \"Tie: Mention\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the nodes stay in the same place in both plots:\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 4, 1))\n\nl <- layout_with_fr(net)\nplot(net.h,\n     vertex.color = \"orange\",\n     layout = l,\n     main = \"Tie: Hyperlink\")\nplot(net.m,\n     vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue2\",\n     layout = l,\n     main = \"Tie: Mention\")\n\n\n\n\n\n#Using tidygraph\n\nlayout <- layout_in_circle(net)\np1 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  filter(type == \"hyperlink\") %>% \n  \n  # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"orange\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Hyperlink\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\np2 <- tbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>% \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  filter(type == \"mention\") %>% \n   # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"lightsteelblue2\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Mention\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nwrap_plots(p1, p2,guides = \"collect\") & \n  # note this \"pipe\" for patchwork!\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nIn our example network, we don’t have node dyads connected by multiple types of connections (we never have both a ‘hyperlink’ and a ‘mention’ tie between the same two news outlets) – however that could happen.\nNote: See the edges between s03 and s10…these are in opposite directions. So no dyads.\n\nlayout <- layout_in_circle(net)\ntbl_graph(nodes, links, directed = TRUE) %>%  \n  activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(size = centrality_degree()) %>% \n\n  # reusing the earlier computed layout\n  ggraph(layout = layout) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.05, aes(colour = type)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = size), shape = 21, \n                  fill = \"orange\") +\n  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), repel = TRUE) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = \"Tie: Hyperlink\") + \n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,,\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nOne challenge in visualizing multiplex networks is that multiple edges between the same two nodes may get plotted on top of each other in a way that makes them impossible to distinguish. For example, let us generate a simple multiplex network with two nodes and three ties between them:\n\nmultigtr <- graph(edges = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2), n = 2)\n\nl <- layout_with_kk(multigtr)\n\n# Let's just plot the graph:\nplot(\n  multigtr,\n  vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue\",\n  vertex.frame.color = \"white\",\n  vertex.size = 40,\n  vertex.shape = \"circle\",\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.color = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\"),\n  edge.width = 10,\n  edge.arrow.size = 5,\n  edge.curved = 0.1,\n  layout = l\n)\n\n\n\n# Using tidygraph\nmultigtr %>% \n  as_tbl_graph() %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  mutate(edge_col = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\")) %>% \nggraph(., layout = l) +\n  geom_edge_arc(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col)) + \n  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = \"lightsteelblue\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nBecause all edges in the graph have the same curvature, they are drawn over each other so that we only see the last one. What we can do is assign each edge a different curvature. One useful function in ‘igraph’ called curve_multiple() can help us here. For a graph G, curve.multiple(G) will generate a curvature for each edge that maximizes visibility.\n\nplot(\n  multigtr,\n  vertex.color = \"lightsteelblue\",\n  vertex.frame.color = \"white\",\n  vertex.size = 40,\n  vertex.shape = \"circle\",\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.color = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\"),\n  edge.width = 10,\n  edge.arrow.size = 5,\n  edge.curved = curve_multiple(multigtr),\n  layout = l\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nmultigtr %>% \n  as_tbl_graph() %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  mutate(edge_col = c(\"gold\", \"tomato\", \"yellowgreen\")) %>% \nggraph(., layout = l) +\n  geom_edge_fan(strength = 0.1, aes(colour = edge_col),width = 2) + \n  geom_node_point(size = 4, colour = \"lightsteelblue\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is the end of this reoworked tutorial!

    "text": "Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary\nThe movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast includes Peter O’Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden, and Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The editing of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. (https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/)\nLawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely well read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an expert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to his being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a lowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General that Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what kind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.\nHere is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this time.11 I was not able to ascertain who is the author of this map. I would be happy to write to obtain permission and use it with acknowledgement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the way to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct experience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a Harith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily rejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi Safra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears the camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid by Turkish airplanes.\nLater in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to retreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where the British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the Turks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the British navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there. Brighton simply scoffs at that idea, because the Turkish have 12 inch guns at Aqaba and the British have other things to do.\nLawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the Koran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the meeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to his intentions in Arabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own interpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not necessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is not in favour of the Arab Army’s retreat to Yenbo, as it would become one small part of the British Army. As a parting remark, Feisal says to Lawrence that the Arabs need what no man can provide, a miracle.\nHere is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene."

    "text": "Lawrence’s Problem\nLawrence does not sleep that night. Provoked by Feisal’s parting remark, he sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about how Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting from where they were, and even advance if possible with British help. His detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of the Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba is a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai Peninsula.\nIn the early morning, seemingly in a eureka moment, he decides that attacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since the guns there could not be turned around.\nHere is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:\n\n\n\n\nLawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is Ali who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not consider Brighton as a member of his Field (as defined by Csikszentmihalyi in his Creativity Systems Model), but Feisal is a Field Member to Ali.\nApropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation and Elaboration stages of the 5 Stages of Creativity from Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration, Execution)."

    "section": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba",
    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as follows:\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k), we identify knobs or parameters within the situation and see how turning these could lead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nHere below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram for this purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning the knobs/parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if the British allies attack Aqaba, they may win, BUT they may lose a few warships. If the Arabs want to attack, they are too small in number and have no warships, and hence their chances of success are very slim. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take Aqaba without losing British ships.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define the Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the big guns there should have no effect.\n\n\nNote how the tone of this IFR is like a “eat my cake and have it too”. Very typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC). We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways2:2 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Increase Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12) and not worsen Stability of Objects Composition (21)- TC 2: Increase Stability of Objects Composition (21) and not worsen Duration of Action of a Moving Object (12)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba should not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Power(18) or Illumination Intensity(23) to “metaphorize” the effectiveness of the attack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could even stretch to making a Physical Contradiction(PC)3 happen:3 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same time)"

    "section": "Solving the Technical Contradiction",
    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 24 (Intermediary)\n\nIP 40 (Composite Materials)\n\nand (TC2)\n\nIP 10 (Preliminary Action)\n\nIP 5 (Merging)\n\nIP 35 (Parameter Change)\n\nIP 13 (The Other Way Around)\n\nHow are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an imaginative exercise as we map these Generalized Solutions back into the Problem at hand:\n\nIP 13: The Other Way Around. How? Not attack by sea? Wait…ATTACK BY LAND!! Change the DIRECTION of Attack! So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too). Will this work? Yes, the guns can’t turn around !!\nIP 35: Parameter Change. But “ships” on land?? Note, the desert is an ocean into which no oar is dipped. Sand and Water are both Resources in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy are being substituted with the use of ….Camels!! And, metaphorically speaking, it is still an attack using ships….The Ships of the Desert!! Parameter Change.\nIP 10: Prior Action. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba and cannot do anything “in advance”. What could this be?\nIP 5: Merging. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali must recruit the Howeitat tribe “in advance” of their attack !! As Lawrence tells Ali, If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they might be 50 men other men would join. This is in accordance with what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, in advance of the attack.\nIP 40: Composite Materials. What object within the situation can we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British Army…so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite into one composite army.\nAnd, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a composite force with camels…\n\nSo IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a camel-borne attack from the landward side. IP 10 also teams up with IP 40 and IP 5 to give the idea of tribe unification.\nAnd so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba port from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and take it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!\nHere is the final solution in action !!\n\n\n\n\n I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up !!"

It is he who has the problem and he who is going to apply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an analysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including the formulation of the Contradiction, Identification of Causes, the statement of the Ideal Final Result, and finally using the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix to find Inventive Principles, that lead to the solution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !\nFirst a philosophical digression:—\nSeveral authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse’s famous book titled Finite and Infinite Games speaks of Play, Types of Games, Rules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar articulation is, in my opinion, that of Mihaly Csikszentlmihalyi in his concept of Flow, shown here below:\n\n\nFrom Sketchplanations\n\n\nWhen the Game presents very little Challenge, we are bored. When the Game demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we experience anxiety. When the Challenge presented is just barely matched by our Skill, we are in the zone of Flow, or what I call Play.\nA good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:— that we live in a space where the Floor of Boredom is always rising and would crush us against our Ceiling of Anxiety. One Way to deal with this is to develop more Skills and push the Ceiling away, effectively moving into the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse suggests: When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.\nSo what does all this have to do with getting veggies?\nThe ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And not offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, “YM”) simply has to accompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will exaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young people likely to read this, and say that he would rather not be there but he does not want to hurt Mom.\nWe are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!"

If he doesn’t go, then he chills at home, but Mom is going to justifiably furious. Herein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: The YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the Waste of Time, and being bored, and Stress at being away from friends.\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR: The YM must go to the Market and not be bored.\n\n\nNote again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs practice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of Six Impossible Things before Breakfast ! Also note there could be other ways of specifying the IFR. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways1:1 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Improve Loss of Time (26) and not worsen Effect of External Harmful Factors (30)\n- TC 2: Improve Increase Productivity (44) and not worsen Stress (19)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the Market may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Noise(29) as the “metaphoric thing” to avoid, but the current IFR doesn’t quite support that. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the language of TRIZ.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:2 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The YM must be in the market and not be in the market at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed squarely at one of the Assumptions in the Problem, that the YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC. See below, section Alternative Ideas for IFR.\nIn a future post, we will deal with using the PC and the TRIZ Separation Principles to solve Problems."

    "text": "A TRIZ Analysis of the Dyson O-Wind Generator\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as before:\n\nFirst, using the method described in Open Source TRIZ, we identify knobs or parameters within the situation\nWe see how turning these could lead to identifying a Statement / Cause for a Problem in the form of a Contradiction.\nRe-word the plain English Contradiction into TRIZ Parameters and look it up in the Contradiction Matrix. Obtain the Inventive Principles.\nApply these Inventive Principles into your Problem and solve it.\n\nIn the video itself, we heard about how electrical power consumption centers are the urban areas and these are far away from the generation sites. Local generation is a good idea to reduce these costs.\nWhat would be the problems with using Wind based power generation around the home? Here below is a quick Ishikawa Diagram to help us identify the Parameters of this Problem:\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this Diagram, with the aspects identified, we could pair them off and see how they affect one another. In doing so, we could make up several problem. Let us state at some of our Problems: I have marked some of these with question marks since I am using imagination here and not direct primary research or information to formulate these. Note that some these may sound very naive, but that is way to start!\n\nI would like to have access the the OWind but it needs to be not too close to the walls for it to harness the wind?\nHow to tap the power from the generator? What if the connection wires get twisted? ( (Do I need a [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_(electric)) like arrangement?)\n\nas an Administrative Contradiction(AC) in plain English:\n\n\nAC: We wish to pull out plastics from the river without interrupting other human activities (economic / recreational / transportation )\n\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa Diagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ Ideal Final Result:\n\n\nIFR:The River must flow. The Plastics must not.\n\n\nShort and pithy.\nWe could do alternative Problem Definitions too, depending upon what our focus was. (Our focus here is the river). The way we would look at the Parameters in the Ishikawa Diagram would be different in each case. More on this in just a bit!\nLet us take our AC and convert it into a Technical Contradiction(TC), keeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the 48 TRIZ Parameters in the TRIZContradictionMatrix (PDF) and see which Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what we can obtain. We will analyze the Contradiction both ways1:1 The Contradiction Matrix is not quite symmetric, so stating the Contradiction both ways allows us to access a slightly larger set of Inventive Principles from two cells of the Matrix.\n\n- TC 1: Increase Volume of Stationary Object(8) and not worsen Harmful effects acting on the system(40)\n- TC 2: Improve Harmful effects acting on the system(40) and not worsen Volume of Stationary Object(8)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR, which also reflects that we choose the make the river our focus. We want to increase the volume of the stationary plastic in the river, while not worsening the harmful effects acting on the river. Note how the IFR is included here, in using the word stationary for the object: the plastic must not flow, while the river must.\nAs stated in my previous articles ( Lawrence of Arabia and Spotify), there is considerable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations of the AC, using the language of TRIZ, the 48 Parameters in the Contradiction Matrix. Parameters chosen from the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as metaphors for the knobs that lie within our AC; Going from the AC to the TC is an act of making metaphors. We could easily have chosen the Parameter Amount of Substance (10) i.e. the plastic on the river, as the “metaphoric thing” to improve but the current IFR speaks of the river. Or we could choose Aesthetics and Appearance (39) as our target, leading to different solutions perhaps, but in a focussed manner. TRIZ tends to focus our attention like no other method that I know of.\nWe could also formulate a Physical Contradiction(PC)2:2 Arriving at Physical Contradictions is not always easy! If we can, then there are a very crisp set of TRIZ Separation Principles that we can apply to solve the Problem.\n\n\nPC: The Plastic must be in the River and not in the River at the same time.\n\n\nwhich is aimed at the river, as with the IFR. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we could obtain a very different set of AC and PC."

    "text": "Solving the Technical Contradiction\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive at the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution for TC-1 in the figure below; The square for solutions to TC-1 has been circled in red.\n\nHere is what the Matrix suggests:\nFor TC-1:\n\n39(Inert Atmosphere)\n24(Intermediary)\n19(Periodic Action)\n\n27(Cheap Short-Living Objects) (!!)\nand with TC-2:\n\n5(Merging)\n17(Another Dimension)\n39(Inert Atmosphere)\n19(Periodic Action)\n\nThis is neat list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some these Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we Generalized Solutions we try to map these back into the Problem at hand:\n\n\n(39)Inert Atmosphere: Hmm…what can be inert in the River? What could “inert” mean here? The River should be inert…so must not flow! OK, so a place where it must be still, perhaps!!\n\n24(Intermediary): OK, something between the River and the Plastic. But…we don’t want nets or dams or weirs…then what? Need to think!!\n\n19(Periodic Action): What can be “periodic” in the River? Waves? But how do we make waves? Need to think some more!!\n\n27(Cheap Short Living Objects): What can be cheap short and short living in the River water? Not fish, surely…wait, BUBBLES!!!\n\nSo (breathlessly): we create bubbles in the water and use them as an Intermediary to create waves/barriers that nudge the Plastic where we want it it to be, for collection. And of course bubbles are both Inert and Atmosphere, literally! And they are Cheap and Short-Lived so we need to regenerate them Periodically! We can periodically sweep the river with a broom made of bubbles and not seriously disturb any other activity. Waah TRIZ, waah!\n5(Merging) is quite easy to interpret now, in retrospect. 17(Another Dimension) is also evocative and powerful as a Solution: the River flows horizontally but the barrier we need to create is vertical. Yet another interpretation could be that the Bubbles dissolve in the River water (assuming another dimension, as it were) and give us the benefit of purifying the water too, as fountains do!!\nSo there you have it! It seems that Going Dutch even with bubbles, is a good idea !"

    "text": "Using TRIZ Separation Principles\nAs Hipple explains, there is frequently an underlying physical parameter, such as length, breadth, weight, or energy, or speed for example that lies at the root of our Technical Contradiction.\nOur IFR states that we want the Plastics to not flow, and the River to flow at the same time. But the Plastics are in the River! This is a sort of a Physical Contradiction!\nCan we make the River “less of a River” in places? Can we make separate zones in the River that flow and not flow, and allow us to harvest the plastic?Indeed,our Inventive Principles such as (39)Inert Atmosphere and 24(Intermediary) suggest such a “spatial” separation. So we are applying SEPARATION in SPACE here, to solve a Physical Contradiction related to “time”. TRIZ offers us a smaller and more easily “memorizable” set of metaphoric solutions in the form of Separation Principles. Here they are:\n\nSeparation in Time\nSeparation in Space\nSeparation on Condition\nSeparation between Parts and the Whole\n\nNote that while these Separation Principles are just a handful to memorize, they are in my opinion, a little harder to apply straightway. But then practice would help us. Note that all the Inventive Principles in the Matrix can be, and have been, classified as to whether they hew to a particular kind of Separation Principle.\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ, please send me a DM! Thanks !"

    "text": "A Famous Lady and her Famous Experiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia. After the Russian Navy destroyed a Turkish squadron in the Black Sea, Great Britain and France joined with Turkey. In September of the following year, the British landed on the Crimean Peninsula and set out, with the French and Turks, to take the Russian naval base at Sevastopol.\nWhat followed was a tragicomedy of errors – failure of supply, failed communications, international rivalries. Conditions in the armies were terrible, and disease ate through their ranks. They finally did take Sevastopol a year later, after a ghastly assault. It was ugly business all around. Well over half a million soldiers lost their lives during the Crimean War."
