## {{< iconify openmoji japanese-symbol-for-beginner >}} Introduction

Sometimes the dependent variable is Qualitative: an either/or
categorization. for example, or the variable we want to predict might be
`won` or `lost` the contest, `has an ailment` or `not`, `voted` or `not`
in the last election, or `graduated` from college or `not`. There might
even be more than two categories such as `voted for Congress`, `BJP`, or
`Independent`; or `never smoker`, `former smoker`, or `current smoker`.

## {{< iconify radix-icons box-model >}} The Logistic Regression Model

We saw with the **General Linear Model** that it models the **mean** of
a target *Quantitative* variable as a linear weighted sum of the
predictor variables:

$$
\Large{y \sim N(x_i^T * \beta, ~~\sigma^2)}
$$ {#eq-general-linear-model}

This model is considered to be **general** because of the dependence on
potentially *more than one explanatory variable*, v.s. the **simple**
linear model:[^1] $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_1 + \epsilon$. The general
linear model gives us model "shapes" that start from [a simple straight
line to a *p-dimensional hyperplane*]{.black .bg-yellow}.

Although a very useful framework, there are some situations where
general linear models are not appropriate:

-   the range of Y is restricted (e.g. binary, count)
-   the variance of Y depends on the mean (Taylor's Law)[^2]

How do we use the familiar *linear model* framework when the
target/dependent variable is *Categorical*?

### Linear Models for Categorical Targets?

Recall that we spoke of
`dummy-encoded  Qualitative **predictor** variables` for our linear
models and how we would **dummy encode** them using numerical values,
such as 0 and 1, or +1 and -1. Could we try the same way for a
**target** categorical variable?

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*X_i + \epsilon_i\\ \nonumber
$$ $$
where\\\
$$

$$
\begin{align}
Y_i &= 0 ~ if ~~~"No"\\ \nonumber
    &= 1 ~ if ~~~ "Yes"  \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

Sadly this seems to not work for categorical dependent variables using a
simple linear model as before. Consider the Credit Card `Default` data
from the package `ISLR`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
data(Default, package = "ISLR")
###
default_modified <- 
  Default %>%
## Convert diagnosis to factor
  # mutate(default_factor = factor(default, levels = c("No", "Yes"),
  #                           labels = c("0", "1"))) %>%
## New Variable for graphing with gf_smooth(glm)
mutate(default_yes = if_else(default == "Yes", 1, 0))
default_modified

```

We see `balance` and `income` are quantitative **predictors**; `student`
is a qualitative predictor, and `default` is a qualitative **target**
variable. If we naively use a linear model equation as
`model = lm(default ~ balance, data = Default)` and plot it, then...

```
:::

...it is pretty much clear from @fig-naive-linear-model that something
is very odd. (no pun intended! See below!) If the only possible values
for `default` are $No = 0$ and $Yes = 1$, how could we interpret
predicted value of, say, $Y_i = 0.25$ or $Y_i = 1.55$, or perhaps
$Y_i = -0.22$? Anything other than Yes/No is hard to interpret!

### {{< iconify ic baseline-report-problem >}} {{< iconify ant-design solution-outlined >}} Problems...and Solutions

Where do we go from here?

Let us state what we might desire of our model:

1.  **Model Equation**: Despite this setback, we would still like our
    model to be as close as possible to the familiar linear model
    equation. 
    
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*X_i + \epsilon_i\\ \nonumber
    $$ 
    
    $$
    where\\\
    $$ $$
    \begin{align}
    Y_i &= 0 ~ if ~~~"No"\\ \nonumber
    &= 1 ~ if ~~~ "Yes"  \nonumber
    \end{align}
    $$ {#eq-linear-model}

2.  **Predictors and Weights**: We have quantitative **predictors** so
    we still want to use a linear-weighted sum for the RHS (i.e
    predictor side) of the model equation. 
    What can we try to make this work? Especially for the LHS (i.e the
target side)?

3.  **Making the LHS continuous**: What can we try? In dummy encoding
    our target variable, we found a range of \[0,1\], [which is the same
    range for a **probability** value]{.black .bg-yellow}! Could we try
    to use **probability of the outcome** as our target, even though we
    are interested in binary outcomes? This would still leave us with a
    range of $[0,1]$ for the target variable, as before.

:::::: callout-note
#### Binomially distributed target variable

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Set graph theme

gf_fun(p *(1 - p) *n ~ p, xlim = c(0, 1), linewidth = 1) %>% 
    gf_labs(x = "Probability p",
    y = "Variance",
    title = "Variance vs Mean: A Nonlinear Relationship",
    subtitle = "For the Binomial Distribution of p"
  )

```
:::

::: g-col-6

[If we map our Categorical/Qualitative target variable into a
Quantitative probability]{.black .bg-yellow}, we need immediately to
look at the [**LINE** assumptions in linear
regression](../LinReg/index.qmd#sec-assumptions-in-linear-models).

:::

:::::
[In linear regression, we assume a normally distributed target
variable]{.black .bg-yellow}, i.e. the residuals/errors around the
predicted value are normally distributed. With a categorical target
variable with two levels $0$ and $1$ it would be impossible for the
errors $e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$ to have a *normal distribution*, as
assumed for the statistical tests to be valid. The errors are bounded by
$[0,1]$! [One candidate for the error distribution in this case is the
*binomial distribution*]{.black .bg-yellow}, whose mean and variance are
`p` and `np(1-p)` respectively.

Note immediately that **the binomial variance moves with the mean**!
The LINE assumption of *normality* is clearly violated. And from the
figure above, extreme probabilities (near 1 or 0) are more stable (i.e.,
have less error variance) than middle probabilities. So the model has
[*"built-in" heteroscedasticity*]{.black .bg-yellow}, which we need to
counter with transformations such as the $log()$ function. More on this
very shortly!
::::::

4.  **Odds**?: How would one "extend" the range of a target variable
    from \[0,1\] to $[-\infty, \infty]$ ? One step would be to try the
    **odds of the outcome**, instead of trying to predict the outcomes
    directly (Yes or No), or their probabilities $[0,1]$.

::: callout-note
#### Odds

Odds of an event with probability `p` of occurrence is defined as
$Odds = p/(1-p)$. As can be seen, the odds are the *ratio* of two
probabilities, that of the event and its complement. In the `Default`
dataset just considered, the odds of default and the odds of non-default
can be calculated as:

```{r}
#| echo: false
default_modified %>% group_by(default) %>% count()

```

$$
\begin{align}
p(Default) &= 333/(333 + 9667)\\ \nonumber
           &= 0.333\\ \nonumber
\end{align}
$$ 


therefore: 

$$
\begin{align}
Odds~of~Default &=p(Default)/(1-p(Default))\\ \nonumber
            &= 0.333/(1-0.333)\\ \nonumber
            &= 0.5\\
\end{align}
$$

and `OddsNoDefault` = $0.9667/(1-0.9667) = 29$.

Now, [*odds* cover half of real number line, i.e. $[0, \infty]$]{.black
.bg-yellow} ! Clearly, when the probability `p` of an event is $0$, the
odds are $0$...and when it nears $1$, the odds tend to $\infty$. So we
have **transformed** a simple probability that lies between $[0,1]$ to
odds lying between $[0, \infty]$. That's one step towards making a
linear model possible; we have "removed" one of the limits on our linear
model's prediction range by using `Odds` as our target variable.
:::

5.  **Transformation using `log()`?**: We need one more leap of faith:
    how do we convert a $[0, \infty]$ range to a $[-\infty, \infty]$?
    Can we try a log transformation?


$$
log([0, \infty]) ~ = ~ [-\infty, \infty]
$$ 


This extends the range of our Qualitative target to the same as with
a Quantitative target!

There is an additional benefit if this `log()` transformation: the
**Error Distributions with Odds targets**. See the plot below. Odds are
a necessarily nonlinear function of probability; the slope of
`Odds ~ probability` also depends upon the probability itself, as we saw
with the probability curve earlier.

gf_fun(p / (1 - p) ~ p, xlim = c(0.01, 0.9), linewidth = 1) %>% 
  gf_labs(
    x = "Probability p",
    y= "Odds",
    title = "Odds vs Probability",
    subtitle = "A Nonlinear Relationship")

###
p <- seq(0.01, 0.95,0.01)
odds <- p/(1-p)

gf_line(log(odds)~ log(p),linewidth = 1) %>% 
  gf_labs(
    x = "log Probability p",
    y= "log Odds",
    title = "With log Transformation",
    subtitle = "More linear now..")

```

To understand this issue intuitively, consider what happens to, say, a
5% change in the odds ratio near 1.0. If the odds ratio is $1.0$, then
the probabilities `p` and `1-p` are $0.5$, and $0.5$. A 20% increase in
the odds ratio to $1.20$ would correspond to probabilities of $0.545$
and $0.455$. However, if the original probabilities were $0.9$ and $0.1$
for an odds ratio $9$, then a 20% increase (in odds ratio) to $10.8$
would correspond to probabilities of $0.915$ and $0.085$, a much smaller
change in the probabilities. The basic curve is non-linear and the `log`
transformation flattens this out to provide a more linear relationship,
which is what we desire.

So in our model, instead of modeling *odds* as the dependent variable,
we will use $log(odds)$, also known as the **logit**, defined as:

$$
\begin{align}
log(odds_i) &= log\bigg[p_i/(1-p_i)\bigg]\\ \nonumber
            &= logit(p_i)\\ 
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-logit}

This is our **Logistic Regression Model**, which uses a Quantitative
Predictor variable to predict a Categorical target variable. We write
the model as ( for the `Default` dataset ) :

$$
\Large{logit(default) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance}
$$ {#eq-logistic-regression-1}


This means that:

$$
log(p(default)/(1-p(default))) = \beta_0+\beta_1 * balance
$$ 
and therefore: 

$$
\begin{align}
p(default) &= \frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance)}{1 + exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance)}\\
&= \frac{1}{1 + exp^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance)}}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-logistic-regression-2}

From the @eq-logistic-regression-1 above it should be clear that a *unit
increase* in `balance` should increase the odds of `default` by
$\beta_1$ units. The RHS of @eq-logistic-regression-2 is a *sigmoid*
function of the weighted sum of predictors and is limited to the range
\[0,1\].

```

If we were to include `income` also as a *predictor* variable in the
model, we might obtain something like:
:::

$$
\begin{align}
p(default) &= \frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance + \beta_2 * income)}{1 + exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance + \beta_2 * income)}\\
&= \frac{1}{1 + exp^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 * balance + \beta_2 * income)}}
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-logistic-regression-3}

This model @eq-logistic-regression-3 is plotted a little differently,
since it includes *three variables*. We'll see this shortly, with code.
The thing to note is that the formula inside the `exp()` is a **linear
combination** of the predictors!

5.  **Estimation of Model Parameters**: The parameters $\beta_i$ now
    need to be estimated. How might we do that? This last problem is
    that because we have made so many transformations to get to the
    `logits` that we want to model, the logic of minimizing the **sum of
    squared errors(SSE)** is no longer appropriate.

::: callout-note
#### Infinite SSE!!

The probabilities for `default` are $0$ and $1$. At these values [the
`log(odds)` will map respectively to $-\infty$ and $\infty$]{.black
.bg-red} `r emoji::emoji("scream-cat")`. So if we naively try to take
residuals, we will find that they are **all** $\infty$ !! Hence the Sum of Squared Errors $SSE$ cannot be computed and we need another way to assess the quality of our
model.
:::

Instead, we will have to use [**maximum likelihood
estimation(MLE)**](./#workflow-model-building) to estimate the
models. The *maximum likelihood method* maximizes the probability of obtaining the data at hand against every choice of model parameters $\beta_i$. (And compare that method with the $X^2$ ("chi-squared") test and statistic instead of `t` and `F` to evaluate the model comparisons)

:::: {.content-hidden when-format="html"}
## {{< iconify tdesign function-curve >}} Generalized Linear Model

::: callout-important
A **generalized linear model** is made up of a linear predictor:

$$
\eta_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi}
$$

and two functions:

-   a link function that describes how the mean, $E(Y_i) = \mu_i$,
    depends on the linear predictor:\

$$
    g(\mu_i) = \eta_i
$$

-   a variance function that describes how the variance, $var(Y_i)$
    depends on the mean:\

$$
    var(Y_i) = \Phi*V(\mu_i)
$$

where the dispersion parameter $\Phi$ is a constant.
:::

For example we can obtain our *general linear model* with the following
choice:

$$
\begin{align}
& g(\mu_i) = \mu_i\\
& Phi = 1
\end{align}
$$

If now we assume that the *target* variable $Y_i$ is a **binomial**,
i.e. a two-valued variable:\

$$
\begin{align}
 & Y_i = binom(n_i,p_i)\\
 & mean(Y_i) = n_ip_i\\
 & var(Y_i) = n_ip_i(1-p_i)
\end{align}
$$

Now, we wish to model the **proportions** $Y_i/n_i$, as our **target**.
Then we can state that:\

$$
\begin{align}
mean(Y_i/n_i) = p_i := \mu_i\\
var(Y_i/n_i) = var(Y_i)/n_i^2 = \frac{p_i(1-p_i)}{n_i} := \sigma_i^2\\
\end{align}
$$

Inspecting the above, we can write:

$$
\sigma_i^2 = \frac{\mu_i(1-\mu_i)}{n_i}
$$

and since the link function needs to map ${[-\infty, \infty]}$ to
${[0,1]}$, we use the `logit` function:

$$
g(\mu_i) = logit(\mu_i) = log(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i})
$$

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Breast Cancer Dataset

Let us proceed with the logistic regression workflow. We will use the
well-known `Wisconsin breast cancer` dataset, readily available from
[Vincent Arel-Bundock's
website.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Read the Data

```{r}

cancer <- read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/dslabs/brca.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
glimpse(cancer)
skim(cancer)
```

We see that there are 31 Quantitative variables, all named as `x_***`,
and one Qualitative variable,`y`, which is a two-level target. (B =
Benign, M = Malignant). The dataset has 569 observations, and no missing
data.

### {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Data Munging

Let us rename `y` as `diagnosis` and take two other Quantitative
parameters as `predictors`, suitably naming them too. We will also
create a binary-valued variable called `diagnosis_malignant` (Binary,
Malignant = 1, Benign = 0) for use as a `target` in our logistic
regression model.

```{r}
#| label: data-munging
#| code-fold: true
cancer_modified <- cancer %>%
  rename(
    "diagnosis" = y,
    "radius_mean" = x_radius_mean,
    "concave_points_mean" = x_concave_pts_mean) %>%
  ## Convert diagnosis to factor
  mutate(diagnosis = factor(
    diagnosis,
    levels = c("B", "M"),
    labels = c("B", "M"))) %>% 
  ## New Variable
  mutate(diagnosis_malignant = if_else(diagnosis == "M", 1, 0)) %>% 
  select(radius_mean, concave_points_mean, diagnosis, diagnosis_malignant)

#### Research Question

How can we predict whether a cancerous tumour is `Benign` or
`Malignant`, based on the variable `radius_mean` **alone**, and with
both `radius_mean` and `concave_points_mean`?

dataset:

#### Business Insights from GGally::ggpairs

-   The counts for "B" and "M" are not terribly unbalanced; and both the
    `radius_mean` and `concave_pts_mean` appear to have well-separated
    box plot distributions for "B" and "M".
-   Given the visible separation of the box-plots for both variables
    `radius_mean` and `concave_pts_mean`, we can believe that these will
    be good choices as predictors.
-   Interestingly, `radius_mean` and `concave_pts_mean` are also
    mutually well-correlated, with a $\rho = 0.823$; we may wish (later)
    to choose (a pair of) predictor variables that are less strongly
    correlated.

#### {{< iconify mingcute code-fill >}} Model Code

Let us code two models, using one and then both the predictor variables:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simple-model
#| code-fold: true
#| tbl-cap: "Simple Model"
#| 
cancer_fit_1 <- glm(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean, 
                  data = cancer_modified, 
                  family = binomial(link = "logit")) 

cancer_fit_1 %>% broom::tidy()
```

The equation for the simple model is:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
equatiomatic::extract_eq(cancer_fit_1, use_coefs = TRUE,
                         wrap = TRUE, show_distribution = TRUE,
                         label = "simple-model"
                           )
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{diagnosis\_malignant} &\sim Bernoulli\left(\operatorname{prob}_{\operatorname{diagnosis\_malignant} = \operatorname{1}}= \hat{P}\right) \\
 \log\left[ \frac { \hat{P} }{ 1 - \hat{P} } \right] 
 &= -15.25 + 1.03(\operatorname{radius\_mean})
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-simple-model}

Increasing `radius_mean` by one unit changes the log odds by
$\hat{\beta_1} = 1.033$ or equivalently it multiplies the odds by
$exp(\hat{\beta_1}) =  2.809$. We can plot the model as shown below:

```{r}
#| label: fig-model-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "Simple Model plot"
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##
qthresh <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8)
beta01 <- coef(cancer_fit_1)[1]
beta11 <- coef(cancer_fit_1)[2]
decision_point <- (log(qthresh / (1 - qthresh)) - beta01) / beta11
##
cancer_modified %>%
  gf_point(
    diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean,
    colour = ~ diagnosis,
    title = "diagnosis ~ radius_mean",
    xlab = "Average radius",
    ylab = "Diagnosis (1=malignant)", size = 3, show.legend = F) %>%
  # gf_fun(exp(1.033 * radius_mean - 15.25) / (1 + exp(1.033 * radius_mean - 15.25)) ~ radius_mean, xlim = c(1, 30), linewidth = 3, colour = "red") %>%
  gf_smooth(
    method = glm,
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
    se = FALSE,
    color = "black"
  ) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = decision_point, linetype = "dashed") %>%
  gf_refine(annotate(
    "text",
    label = paste0("q = ", qthresh),
    x = decision_point + 0.45,
    y = 0.4,
    angle = -90
  ),
  scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen","red2"))) %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept = 0.5) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme(plot.title.position = "plot")) %>% 
  gf_refine(xlim(5, 30))

  
```

The dotted lines show how the model can be used to classify the data in
to two classes ("B" and "M") depending upon the threshold probability
$q$.

```{r}
#| label: emi-tanaka-1
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| 
ggplot(cancer_modified, aes(radius_mean, diagnosis_malignant)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = diagnosis, shape = diagnosis), alpha = 0.5, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = glm, method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = decision_point, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "red2")) +
  guides(color = "none", shape = "none") +
  labs(title = "diagnosis ~ radius_mean",
       x = "Average radius",
       y = "Diagnosis (1=malignant)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "mono"),
        plot.title.position = "plot") +
  annotate("text", label = paste0("q = ", qthresh), 
           x = decision_point + 0.25, y = 0.4, angle = -90)

```

Taking both predictor variables, we obtain the model:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: tbl-complex-model
cancer_fit_2<- glm(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean + concave_points_mean, 
                  data = cancer_modified, 
                  family = binomial(link = "logit")) 

cancer_fit_2 %>% broom::tidy()
```

The equation for the more complex model is:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
#| 
equatiomatic::extract_eq(cancer_fit_2, use_coefs = TRUE,
                         wrap = TRUE, show_distribution = TRUE,
                         label = "complex-model"
                           )

```

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{diagnosis\_malignant} &\sim Bernoulli\left(\operatorname{prob}_{\operatorname{diagnosis\_malignant} = \operatorname{1}}= \hat{P}\right) \\
 \log\left[ \frac { \hat{P} }{ 1 - \hat{P} } \right] 
 &= -13.7 + 0.64(\operatorname{radius\_mean}) + 84.22(\operatorname{concave\_points\_mean})
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-complex-model}

Increasing `radius_mean` by one unit changes the log odds by
$\hat{\beta_1} = 0.6389$ or equivalently it multiplies the odds by
$exp(\hat{\beta_1}) =  1.894$, provided `concave_points_mean` is held
fixed.

We can plot the model as shown below: we create a scatter plot of the
two predictor variables. The superimposed diagonal lines are lines for
several constant values of threshold probability $q$.

##
decision_intercept <- 1 / beta22 * (log(qthresh / (1 - qthresh)) - beta02)
decision_slope <- -beta12 / beta22
##

## Workflow: Logistic Regression Internals

All that is very well, but what is happening under the hood of the `glm`
command? Consider the `diagnosis` (target) variable and say the
`average_radius` feature/predictor variable. What we do is:

1.  Plot a scatter plot
    `gf_point(diagnosis ~ average_radius, data = cancer_modified)`
2.  Start with a sigmoid curve with some initial parameters
    $\hat{\beta_1}$ and $\hat{\beta_0}$ that gives us some prediction of
    the probability of `diagnosis` for any given `average_radius`
3.  We know the target labels for each data point ( i.e. "B" and "M").
    We can calculate [the ***likelihood*** of $\hat{\beta_1}$ and
    $\hat{\beta_0}$, ***given*** the data]{.black .bg-yellow}.
4.  We then change the values of $\hat{\beta_1}$ and$\hat{\beta_0}$ and
    calculate the likelihood again.
5.  The set of parameters with the ***maximum likelihood(ML)*** for
    $\hat{\beta_1}$ and $\hat{\beta_0}$ gives us our logistic regression
    model.
6.  Use that model henceforth as a model for prediction.

How does one find out the "ML" parameters? There is clearly a two step
procedure:

-   Find the likelihood of the data for the parameters $\beta_1$
-   Maximize the likelihood by varying them. In practice, the changes to
    the parameters (step 5) are made in accordance with a method such as
    the [Newton-Raphson](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/newton-raphson-method/) method that can rapidly find the ML values
    for the parameters.

Let us visualize the variations and computations from step(5). For the
sake of clarity:

-   we will take a small sample of the original dataset
-   we take several different values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
-   Use these get a set of regression curves
-   which we superimpose on the scatter plot of the sample

cancer_modified_sample <- cancer_modified %>%

glm_sample_model <- glm(data = cancer_modified_sample, 
                  diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean,
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"))
#glm_sample_model
beta0_sample = coef(glm_sample_model)[1]
beta1_sample = coef(glm_sample_model)[2]

```

           title = "Multiple Models",
           subtitle = "Varying beta_0 and beta_1") %>% 
  gf_smooth(
    method = glm,
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
    se = FALSE,
    color = "black"
  ) %>%
## Overlaid regression curves
    gf_fun(ilogit(x * (beta1_sample - 0.002) + beta0_sample - 1) ~ x, xlim = c(10,20), color = "red") %>% 
  gf_fun(ilogit(x * (beta1_sample + 0.0075) + beta0_sample + 1) ~ x, xlim = c(10,20), color = "green")


```

In @fig-multiple-models, we see three models: the "optimum" one in
black, and two others in [green]{.black .bg-green} and [red]{.black .bg-red} respectively.

We now project the actual points on to the regression curve, to obtain
the predicted probability for each point.

  curve2 = ilogit(radius_mean * (beta1_sample + 0.0075) + beta0_sample + 1))
#plot_dat
## Now plot the two steps for each regression curve
## 1. Point projection
plot_dat %>% 
  gf_point(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean, 
           colour = ~ diagnosis, size = 4, title = "Data Point Projection") %>% 
    gf_smooth(
    method = glm,
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
    se = FALSE,
    color = "grey"
  ) %>%

  gf_point(curve1 ~ radius_mean, size = 4) %>% 
  gf_segment(curve1 + diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean + radius_mean, arrow = arrow(ends = "first", angle = 15, type = "closed", length = unit(0.125, "inches")))

  # %>% 
  # gf_segment(curve1 + curve1 ~ radius_mean + 0)

## 2. probability lookup
plot_dat %>% 
  gf_point(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean, 
           colour = ~ diagnosis, size = 4, alpha = 0.3,
           title = "Predicted Probability Lookup") %>%

             arrow = arrow(ends = "last", angle = 15, 
                           length = unit(0.1, "inches")))



### Curve 2
## Now plot the two steps for each regression curve
## 1. Point projection
plot_dat %>% 
  gf_point(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean, 
           colour = ~ diagnosis, size = 4, title = "Data Point Projection") %>% 
    gf_smooth(

  gf_point(curve2 ~ radius_mean, size = 4) %>% 
  gf_segment(curve2 + diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean + radius_mean) %>%  gf_segment(curve2 + diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean + radius_mean, arrow = arrow(ends = "first", angle = 15, type = "closed", length = unit(0.125, "inches")))

## 2. probability lookup
plot_dat %>% 
  gf_point(diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean, 
           colour = ~ diagnosis, size = 4, alpha = 0.3,
           title = "Predicted Probability Lookup") %>% 
    gf_smooth(
    method = glm,
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
    se = FALSE,
    color = "grey"
  ) %>%
gf_fun(ilogit(x * (beta1_sample + 0.0075) + beta0_sample + 1) ~ x, xlim = c(10,20), color = "green") %>% 
  gf_point(curve2 ~ radius_mean, size = 4) %>% 
  #gf_segment(curve2 + diagnosis_malignant ~ radius_mean + radius_mean) %>% 
  gf_segment(curve2 + curve2 ~ radius_mean + 10, arrow = arrow(ends = "last", angle = 15, length = unit(0.1, "inches")))

```

The predicted probability $p_i$ for each datum(radius_mean) is for the tumour being Malignant. If the datum corresponds to a tumour that is Benign, we must take $1-p_i$. Each datum point is assumed to be *independent*, so we can calculate the likelihood as a **product of probabilities**, as follows: In this way, we calculate the likelihood of the data, give the model parameters as:

$$
\large{
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
likelihood &=  \prod_{Malignant}^{}p_i ~ \times ~ \prod_{Benign}^{}(1 - p_i)\\
&= \prod_{}^{}p_i^{y_{Malignant = 1}} ~ \times ~ (1-p_i)^{y_{Benign = 1}}\\
&= \prod_{}^{}(p_i)^{y_i} ~\times~ (1-p_i)^{1-y_i}// 
~since~labels~y_i~are~binary~1~or~0//
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
}
$$
Lastly, since this is a product of small numbers, it can lead to inaccuracies, so we take the log of the whole thing to make it into an addition, obtaining the **log-likelihood (LL)**:

$$
\large{
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
log~likelihood ~~ ll(\beta_i) &= log\prod_{}^{}(p_i)^{y_i} * (1-p_i)^{1-y_i}\\
&= \sum_{}^{} y_i * log (p_i) + (1-y_i) * log(1 - p_i)\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
}
$${#eq-log-likelihood}

We now need to find the (global) **maximum** of this quantity and determine the $\beta_i$. Flipping this problem around, we find the *maximum likelihood* by **minimizing** the slope/gradient of of the LL!! And, to minimize the *slope of the LL*, we use the [Newton-Raphson method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/newton-raphson-method/) or equivalent. Phew!

- The black curve $y = fx)$ is the function to be minimized, i.e. it is the **gradient of the LL function**. 
- We start with any arbitrary starting value of $x = x1, y1 = f(x1)$ and calculate the tangent/slope/gradient equation $f'(x1)$ at point $(x1, y1) = (x1, f(x1))$. 
- The tangent $f'(x1)$ cuts the $x-axis$ at $x2$.(Grey line).
- Repeat.
- Stop when the gradient becomes very small and $x_i$ changes very in successive iterations.

How do we calculate the next value of x using the tangent?

- At $(x1,y1)$, the tangent equation is: $y = y1 - slope1 * (x - x1)$.
- This equation applies at point $(x2,0$), so $0 = y1 - slope1 *(x2 - x1)$. (NOTE: *Imagine that this is obtained by temporarily moving the y-axis to $x = x1$* (dotted line), so $y1$ in effect is the "c" in $y = mx + c$)
- Solving for $x2$, we get: $x2 = y1/slope1 - x1 = f(x1)/f'(x1)$
- Since $f(x)$ **is already the gradient of LL**, we have: $x2 = x1 - ll'(x1)/ll''(x1)$ !!

To be written up:

- Formula for gradient of LL
- Convergence of Newton- Raphson method for Maximum Likelihood
- Hand Calculation of all steps (!!)

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions

- Logistic Regression is a great ML algorithm for predicting **Qualitative** target variables. 
- It also works for *multi-level/multi-valued* Qual variables (multinomial logistic regression)
- The internals of Logistic Regression are quite different compared to Linear Regression
