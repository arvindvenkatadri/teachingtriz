Golf Drive Distance over the years
:::


What do we see here? In about two-and-a-half decades, golf drive distances have increased, *on the average*, by 35 yards. The maximum distance has also gone up by 30 yards, and the minimum is now at 250 yards, which was close to average in 1983! What was a decent average in 1983 is just the bare minimum in 2017!!

Is it the dimples that the golf balls have? But these have been around a long time...or is it the clubs, and the swing technique invented by more recent players? 

Now, let us listen to the late great Hans Rosling from the [Gapminder
Project](https://www.gapminder.org), which aims at telling stories of
the world with data, to remove systemic biases about poverty, income and
gender related issues.

## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do Histograms Work?

**Histograms** are best to show the distribution of raw **Quantitative data**, by displaying the number of values that fall within defined
ranges, often called *buckets* or *bins*. We use a **Quant** variable on the `x-axis` and the histogram shows us how frequently different values
occur for that variable by showing *counts/frequencies* on the y-axis.
The x-axis is typically broken up into "buckets" or ranges for the
x-variable, And usually you can adjust the bucket ranges to explore
frequency patterns. For example, you can shift histogram buckets from
0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc. to 0-2, 2-4, etc. Histograms do not usually show spaces between buckets because the buckets represent contiguous ranges, while bar charts show spaces to separate each (unconnected) *category/level* within a Qual variable.

Although **Bar Charts** may look similar to **Histograms**, the two are
different. **Bar Charts** show counts of observations with respect to a **Qualitative** variable. For instance, bar charts show *categorical data* with multiple *levels*, such as fruits, clothing, household products in an inventory. Each *bar* has a height proportional to the *count* per shirt-size, in this example. 

## {{< iconify grommet-icons test >}} Case Study-1: `diamonds` dataset

We will first look at at a dataset that is directly available in R, the
`diamonds` dataset. 

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data

As per our Workflow, we will look at the data using all the three
methods we have seen.

### Business Insights on Examining the `diamonds` dataset

-   This is a large dataset (54K rows).
-   There are several Qualitative variables: `cut`, `color` and
    `clarity`. These have 5, 7, and 8 levels respectively. The fact that
    the `class` for these is `ordered` suggests that these are factors 
    and that the levels have a sequence/order.
-   `carat`, `price`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `depth` and `table` are
    Quantitative variables.
-   There are no missing values for any variable, all are complete with
    54K entries.
:::

## {{< iconify  material-symbols lab-research >}} Hypothesis and Research Questions
Let us formulate a few Questions about this dataset. At some point, we might develop a hunch or two, and these would become our hypotheses to investigate. This is an iterative process!

::: callout-note
### Hypothesis and Research Questions
- The `target variable` for an experiment that resulted in this data might be the `price` variable. Which is a numerical Quant variable.\
- There are also `predictor variables` such as `carat` (Quant), `color`(Qual), `cut`(Qual), and `clarity`(Qual).\
- Other `predictor variables` might be `x, y, depth, table`(all Quant)\
- Research Questions:
  - What is the distribution of the target variable `price`?
  - What is the distribution of the predictor variable `carat`?
  - Does a `price` distribution vary based upon type of `cut`, `clarity`, and `color`?

These should do for now. Try and think of more Questions!

### Using ggformula

```{r}

#| layout-ncol: 2
#| message: false
## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##
gf_histogram(~ price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Plot 1A: Diamond Prices",
          caption = "ggformula")
## More bins
gf_histogram(~ price, data = diamonds, bins = 100) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Plot 1B: Diamond Prices",
          caption = "ggformula")

```

### Using ggplot

```{r}
#| label: histogram-price-ggplot
#| message: false

## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = price)) +
  labs(title = "Plot 1A: Diamond Prices",
       caption = "ggplot")
## More bins
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = price), bins = 100) +
  labs(title = "Plot 1B: Diamond Prices",
       caption = "ggplot")

```

### {{< iconify noto-v1 spider-web >}} web-r

```{webr-r}
gf_histogram(~ price, data = diamonds) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Plot 1A: Diamond Prices",
          caption = "ggformula")
## More bins
gf_histogram(~ price, data = diamonds, bins = 100) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Plot 1B: Diamond Prices",
          caption = "ggformula")

```

:::
### Business Insights-1
- The `price` distribution is heavily skewed to the right.\
- There are a great many diamonds at relativly low prices, but there are a good few diamonds at very high prices too.\
- Using a high number of bins does not materially change the view of the histogram.\

  gf_labs(title = "Plot 2B: Carats of Diamonds",
          caption = "ggformula")
```

:::
### Business Insights-2
- `carat` also has a heavily right-skewed distribution.\
- However, there is a marked "discreteness" to the distribution. Some values of carat are far more common than others. For example, 1, 1.5, and 2 carat diamonds are large in number.\
- Why does the X-axis extend up to 5 carats? There must be some, very few, diamonds of very high carat value!

### Business Insights-3

-   The price distribution is heavily skewed to the right AND This
`long-tailed` nature of the histogram holds true **regardless** of the `cut` of the diamond.
-   See the x-axis range for each plot in Plot D! Price ranges are the
    same regardless of cut !! Very surprising! So `cut` is perhaps not
    the only thing that determines price...
-   Facetting the plot into *small multiples* helps look at patterns
    better: overlapping histograms are hard to decipher. Adding `color`
    defines the bars in the histogram very well.
:::

::: callout-important
### A Hypothesis

The surprise insight above should lead you to make a Hypothesis! You
should decide whether you want to investigate this question further,
making more graphs, as we will see. Here, we are making a **Hypothesis**
that more than just `cut` determines the `price` of a diamond.

The data come from the
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), project,
a weekly social learning project dedicated to gaining practical
experience with R and data science. In this case the TidyTuesday data
are based on [International Trail Running Association
(ITRA)](https://itra.run/Races/FindRaceResults) data but inspired by
Benjamin Nowak. We will use the [TidyTuesday data that are on
GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-10-26).
Nowak's data are [also available on
GitHub](https://github.com/BjnNowak/UltraTrailRunning).

### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the race Data

Let us look at the dataset using all our three methods:

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke; border: 1px solid"}

### {{< iconify la r-project >}} R
We will stick with just `glimpse` for this time, and not use `skim` or `inspect` in the interest of brevity:

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-race-data
glimpse(race_df)
glimpse(rank_df)

```

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-race-data-1
#| include: false
skim(race_df)

```

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-race-data-2
#| include: false
skim(rank_df)

```

```{r}
#| label: inspect-race
#| include: false
# inspect(race_df) # does not work with hms and difftime variables
inspect(rank_df)

```
We can also try our new friend `mosaic::favstats`:
```{r}
#| label: race-favstats
race_df %>% 
  favstats(~ distance, data = .)
##
race_df %>% 
  favstats(~ participants, data = .)
##
rank_df %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  favstats(time_in_seconds ~ gender, data = .)

```
::: callout-note
### Introducing `crosstable`
`mosaic::favstats` allows to summarise just one variable at a time. On occasion we may need to see summaries of several Quant variables, over levels of Qual variables. This is where the package `crosstable` is so effective: note how `crosstable` also conveniently uses the **fomula interface** that we are getting accustomed to. 

We will find occasion to meet `crosstable` again when we do [Inference. ](../../Inference/listing.qmd)

### Business Insights from `race` data

-   We have two datasets, one for races (`race_df`) and one for the
    ranking of athletes (`rank_df`).
-   There is atleast one common column between the two, the
    `race_year_id` variable.
-   Overall, there are *Qualitative* variables such as `country`,
    `city`,`gender`, and `participation`. This last variables seems
    badly coded, with entries showing `solo` and `Solo`.
-   *Quantitative variables* are `rank`, `time`,`time_in_seconds`, `age`
    from `rank_df`; and `distance`, `elevation_gain`,
    `elevation_loss`,`particants`, and `aid_stations` from `race_df`.
-   We have 1207 races and over 130K participants! But some races do
    show *zero* participants!! Is that an error in data entry?

So the distribution is (very) roughly bell-shaped, spread over a 2X
range. And some people may have dropped out of the race very early and
hence we have a small bump close to *zero* time! The histogram shows
three bumps...at least one reason is that the distances to be covered
are not the same...but could there be other reasons? Like
`altitude_gained` for example?

We see that finish times tend to be longer for afternoon and evening
start races; these are lower for early morning and night time starts.
Mid-day starts show a curious double hump in finish times that should be
studied.

## {{< iconify entypo new >}} Distributions and Densities in the Wild

Before we conclude, let us look at a real world dataset: populations of
countries. This dataset was taken from Kaggle
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/populations>. Click
on the icon below to save the file into a *subfolder* called `data` in
your project folder:

{{< downloadthis data/populations.csv dname=populations label="Download the Populations data" icon=database-fill-down type=info class=data-button id=populations >}}

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 2
pop <- read_csv("data/populations.csv")
pop
inspect(pop)

```

Let us plot densities/histograms for `value`:

```{r}
#| label: skewed-histogram
#| layout-ncol: 2

## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##

##
gf_histogram(~ value, data = pop, title = "Long Tailed Histogram") 
##
gf_density(~ value, data = pop, title = "Long Tailed Density")

```

These graphs convey very little to us: the data is very heavily skewed
to the right and much of the chart is empty. There are many countries
with small populations and a few countries with very large populations.
Such distributions are also called **"long tailed"** distributions. To
develop better insights with this data, we should transform the variable
concerned, using say a "log" transformation:

```{r}
#| label: skewed-density
#| layout-ncol: 2

## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##

gf_histogram(~ log10(value), data = pop, title = "Histogram with Log transformed x-variable") 
##
gf_density(~ log10(value), data = pop, title = "Density with Log transformed x-variable")

```

Be prepared to transform your data with `log` or `sqrt` transformations
when you see skewed distributions! Salaries, Instagram connections,
number of customers vs Companies, net worth / valuation of Companies,
extreme events on stock markets....all of these could have highly skewed
distributions. In such a case, the standard statistics of mean/median/sd
may not convey too much information.

Several distribution shapes exist, here is an illustration of the 6 most common ones:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Type_of_Distributions
# Build dataset with different distributions
library(hrbrthemes)
data <- data.frame(
  type = c( rep("edge peak", 1000), rep("comb", 1000), rep("normal", 1000), rep("uniform", 1000), rep("bimodal", 1000), rep("skewed", 1000) ),
  value = c( rnorm(900), rep(3, 100), rnorm(360, sd=0.5), rep(c(-1,-0.75,-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0.75), 80), rnorm(1000), runif(1000), rnorm(500, mean=-2), rnorm(500, mean=2), abs(log(rnorm(1000))) )
)

# Represent it
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=value)) +
    geom_histogram(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    facet_wrap(~type, scale="free_x") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      axis.title.x=element_blank(),
      axis.text.x=element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
    )
```

What insights could you develop based on these distribution shapes?\

- *Bimodal*: Maybe two different systems or phenomena or regimes under which the data unfolds. Like our geyser above. Or a machine that works differently when cold and when hot. Intermittent faulty behaviour...\
- *Comb*: Some specific Observations occur predominantly, in an otherwise even spread or observations. In a survey many respondents round off numbers to nearest 100 or 1000. Check the distribution of the diamonds dataset for carat values which are suspiciously integer numbers in too many cases.\
- *Edge Peak*: Could even be a data entry artifact!! All unknown / unrecorded observations are recorded as $999$ !!`r emoji::emoji("scream_cat")`\
- *Normal*: Just what it says! Course Marks in a Univ cohort...\
- *Skewed*: Income, or friends count in a set of people. Do UI/UX peasants have more followers on Insta than say CAP people?\
- *Uniform*: The World is ~~not~~ flat. Anything can happen within a range. But not much happens outside! Sharp limits...

## {{< iconify ph bell-simple-z-duotone >}} Z-scores

Often when we compute wish to compare distributions with different
values for means and standard deviations, we resort to a *scaling* of
the variables that are plotted in the respective distributions.

```{r}
#| label: z-scores-1
#| echo: false
#| layout-nrow: 2
#| column: body-outset-right
library(TeachHist)

## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##

p1 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 60, Sd = 5, VLine1 = 70, AxisFontSize = 14)
xpnorm(mean = 60, sd = 5, q = 70)
# p3 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 10, Sd = 5)
# p2 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 60, Sd = 15)
# xpnorm(mean = 60, sd = 15, q = 70)
# # p4 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 10, Sd = 15)


```

```{r}
#| label: z-scores-2
#| echo: false
#| layout-nrow: 2
#| column: body-outset-right
library(TeachHist)

## Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##

# p1 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 60, Sd = 5,VLine1 = 70)
# xpnorm(mean = 60, sd = 5, q = 70)
# p3 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 10, Sd = 5)
p2 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 60, Sd = 15, VLine1 = 70,AxisFontSize = 14)
xpnorm(mean = 60, sd = 15, q = 70)
# # p4 <- TeachHistDens(Mean = 10, Sd = 15)


```
Although the densities all look the same, they are are quite different!
The x-axis in each case has *two scales*: one is the actual value of the
x-variable, and the other is the *z-score* which is calculated as:

$$
z_x = \frac{x - \mu_{x}}{\sigma_x}
$$

With similar distributions (i.e. normal distributions), we see that the
variation in density is the **same** at the same values of `z-score` for
each variable. However since the $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ are different,
the *absolute* value of the `z-score` is different for each variable. In
the first plot (from the top left), $z = 1$ corresponds to an absolute
change of $5$ units; it is $15$ units in the plot directly below it.

Our comparisons are done easily when we compare differences in
probabilities at identical `z-scores`, or differences in `z-scores` at
identical probabilities.

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion


To complicate matters: Having said all that, the histogram is really a bar chart in disguise! You probably suspect that *the "bucketing" of the Quant variable is tantamount to creating a Qual variable*! Each bucket is a *level* in this fictitious bucketed *Quant* variable. 

-   Histograms, Frequency Distributions, and Box Plots are used for
    Quantitative data variables\
-   Histograms "dwell upon" **counts**, **ranges**, **means** and
    **standard deviations**
-   We can split histograms on the basis of another Qualitative
    variable.
-   Long tailed distributions need care in visualization and in
    inference making!
