## {{< iconify mdi web-check >}} Using web-R

This tutorial uses `web-r` that allows you to run all code within your
browser, on all devices. Most code chunks herein are formatted in a
tabbed structure ( like in an old-fashioned library) with duplicated
code. The tabs in front have regular R code that will work when
copy-pasted in your RStudio session. The tab "behind" has the `web-R`
code that can work directly in your browser, and can be modified as
well. The R code is also there to make sure you have original code to go
back to, when you have made several modifications to the code on the
`web-r` tabs and need to compare your code with the original!

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

-   Run selected code using either:
    -   macOS: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>↩/Return</kbd>
    -   Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↩/Enter</kbd>
-   Run the entire code by clicking the "Run code" button or pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>↩</kbd>.

## {{< fa envelope title="An envelope" >}} Where does Data come from? {#sec-where-data}

We will need to form a basic understanding of basic scientific
enterprise. Let us look at the slides. (Also embedded below!)

## Tidy Data

Each **variable** is a column; a column contains *one kind* of data.
Each **observation** or **case** is a row.
:::

## {{< fa glasses >}} How do we Spot Data Variable Types? {#sec-data-types}

[By asking questions!]{style="background-color: yellow;"} Shown below is
a table of different kinds of questions you could use to query a
dataset. The variable or variables that "answer" the question would be
in the category indicated by the question.

::: column-page
```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
pronouns <- read_csv("pronouns.csv")
pronouns %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)
```
:::

As you go from [Qualitative to Quantitative data
types](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-hello.html#variable-types)
in the table, I hope you can detect a movement from fuzzy
groups/categories to more and more crystallized numbers.

![Type of
Variables](/content/materials/images/Ratio-Interval-Ordinal-Nominal.PNG){fig-align="center"}

Each variable/scale can be subjected to the operations of the previous
group. In the words of [S.S.
Stevens](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/)

> the basic operations needed to create each type of scale is
> cumulative: to an operation listed opposite a particular scale must be
> added all those operations preceding it.

## Some Examples of Data Variables

### Example 1: `AllCountries`

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
#### Base R

```{r}
#| echo: true

head(AllCountries,5) %>% arrange(desc(Internet))
```

#### {{< iconify noto-v1 spider-web >}} web-r

```{webr-r}
head(AllCountries,5) %>% arrange(desc(Internet))
```
:::

::: callout-note
#### Questions

Q1. How many people in Andorra have internet access?\
A1. This leads to the `Internet` variable, which is a Quantitative
variable, a proportion.[^2] The answer is $70.5\%$.
:::

[^2]: How might this data have been obtained? By asking people in a
    survey and getting **Yes/No** answers!

### Example 2:`StudentSurveys`

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
#### Base R

```{r}
#| echo: true

head(StudentSurvey,5)

```

#### {{< iconify noto-v1 spider-web >}} web-r

```{webr-r}
#| echo: false
#| column: body-outset-right
head(StudentSurvey,5)

```

::: callout-note
## Questions

Q.1. *What kind* of students are these?\
A.1. The *variables* `Gender`, and `Year` both answer to this Question.
And they are both Qualitative/Categorical variables, of course.\
Q.2. *What is* their status in their respective families?\
A.2. Hmm...they are either first-born, or second-born, or third...etc.
While this is **recorded** as a number, it is **still a Qualitative**
variable[^3]! Think! Can you do math operations with `BirthOrder`? Like
`mean` or `median`?\
Q.3.**How big** are the families?\
A.3. Clearly, the variable that answers is `Siblings` and since the
question is synonymous with "how many", this is a Quantitative
variable.\
:::

[^3]: Qualitative variables are called *Factor variables* in R, and are
    stored, internally, as numeric variables together with their levels.
    The actual values of the numeric variable are 1, 2, and so on.

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

Let us take a look at Wickham and Grolemund's Data Science workflow picture:

![Data Science Workflow](../../../../../materials/images/workflow.svg){#fig-datascience-workflow height="240px"}

So there we have it:

-   We import and clean the data
-   ***Questions*** lead us to identify Types of Variables (Quant and Qual)\
-   Sometimes we may need to transform the data (long to wide, summarize, create new variables...)
-   Further ***Questions*** lead to *relationships* between variables, which we describe using Data Visualizations\
-   Which is finally Communicated


You might think of all these Questions, Answers, Mapping as being
[equivalent to **metaphors** as a language in itself]{.black .bg-yellow}. And indeed, in R we use a philosophy called the **Grammar of Graphics**! We will use this grammar in the R graphics packages that we will encounter when we make Graphs next. Other parts of the Workflow (Transformation, Analysis and Modelling) are also following similar grammars, as we shall see. 

## {{< iconify eos-icons ai >}} AI Generated Summary and Podcast

This is a tutorial on data visualization using the R programming language. It introduces concepts such as data types, variables, and visualization techniques. The tutorial utilizes metaphors to explain these concepts, emphasizing the use of geometric aesthetics to represent data. It also highlights the importance of both visual and analytic approaches in understanding data. The tutorial then demonstrates basic chart types, including histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts, and discusses the "Grammar of Graphics" philosophy that guides data visualization in R. The text concludes with a workflow diagram for data science, emphasizing the iterative process of data import, cleaning, transformation, visualization, hypothesis generation, analysis, and communication.
