## {{< iconify openmoji japanese-symbol-for-beginner >}} Introduction

Network graphs show relationships between entities: what sort they are,
how strong they are, and even of they change over time.

We will examine data structures pertaining both to the *entities* and
the *relationships* between them and look at the data *object* that can
combine these aspects together. Then we will see how these are plotted,
what the *structure* of the plot looks like. There are also *metrics*
that we can calculate for the network, based on its structure. We will
of course examine geometric metaphors that can represent various classes
of entities and their relationships.

Network graphs can be rendered both as static and interactive and we
will examine R packages that render both kinds of plots.

There is a another kind of structure: one that combines *spatial* and
*network* data in one. We will defer that for a future module !

## What kind Network graphs will we make?

Here is a network map of the characters in Victor Hugo's
`Les Miserables`:

And this: the well known [Zachary's Karate Club
dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club)
visualized as a network

## {{< iconify game-icons stairs-goal >}} Goals

At the end of this Lab session, we should:

-   know the types and structures of `network data` and be able to work
    with them
-   understand the basics of modern network packages in R
-   be able to create network visualizations using `tidygraph`,
    `ggraph`( static visualizations ) and `visNetwork` (interactive
    visualizations)
-   see directions for how the network metaphor applies in a variety of
    domains (e.g. biology/ecology, ideas/influence, technology,
    transportation, to name a few)

## {{< iconify game-icons journey >}} Pedagogical Note

The method followed will be based on
[PRIMM](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/cser/2017/09/01/primm-a-structured-approach-to-teaching-programming/):

-   **PREDICT** Inspect the code and guess at what the code might do,
    **write predictions**
-   **RUN** the code provided and check what happens
-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments
    to explain**. What bells and whistles can you see?
-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the
    `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed
    for and achieved.
-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

## {{< iconify cib graphql >}} Graph Metaphors

Network graphs are characterized by two key terms: **nodes** and
**edges**

1.  `Nodes` : **Entities**

    -   Metaphors: Individual People? Things? Ideas? Places? to be
        connected in the network.
    -   Synonyms: `vertices`. Nodes have `IDs`.

2.  `Edges`: **Connections**

    -   Metaphors: Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Letters sent
        and received? Dependence? between the entities.
    -   Synonyms: `links`, `ties`.

In R, we create network representations using node and edge information.
*One way* in which these could be organized are:

-   `Node list`: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs
    found in the edge list. You can also add **attribute columns** to
    the data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables.
    ( Type? Class? Family? Country? Subject? Race? )

|     |            |                                                          |
|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ID  | Node Name  | Attribute? Qualities?Categories? Family? Country?Planet? |
| 1   | Ned        | Nursery School Teacher                                   |
| 2   | Jaguar Paw | Main Character, Apocalypto                               |
| 3   | John Snow  | Epidemiologist                                           |

: Node Table

-   `Edge list`: data frame containing two columns: **source node** and
    **destination node** of an `edge`. Source and Destination have
    `node IDs`.
-   `Weighted network graph`: An edge list can also contain additional
    columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude
    aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the
    graph is considered weighted.

| From | To  | Relationship       | Weightage |
|------|-----|--------------------|-----------|
| 1    | 3   | Financial Dealings | 6         |
| 2    | 1   | History Lessons    | 2         |
| 2    | 3   | Vaccination        | 15        |

: Edges Table

-   `Layout`: A **geometric** arrangement of `nodes` and `edges`.

    -   Metaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour?
        Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the `arrangement`.

-   `Layout Algorithms` : `Method` to arranges `nodes` and `edges` with
    the aim of optimizing some `metric` .

    -   Metaphors: Nodes are `masses` and edges are `springs`. The
        Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all
        springs.(BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all
        springs?...)

-   `Directed and undirected network graph`: If the distinction between
    source and target is meaningful, the network is **directed.** If the
    distinction is not meaningful, the network is **undirected**.
    **Directed edges** represent an ordering of nodes, like a
    relationship extending from one node to another, where switching the
    direction would change the structure of the network. **Undirected
    edges** are simply links between nodes where order does not matter.

::: callout-tip
## Examples

-   The World Wide Web is an example of a directed network because
    hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily the
    other way around.

-   Co-authorship networks represent examples of un-directed networks,
    where nodes are authors and they are connected by an edge if they
    have written a publication together

-   When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the
    sender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful,
    therefore the network is directed.
:::

-   `Connected` and `Disconnected` graphs: If there is *some* path from
    *any node* to *any other node*, the Networks is said to be
    Connected. Else, Disconnected.

## Predict/Run/Infer-1

### Using `tidygraph` and `ggraph`

`tidygraph` and `ggraph` are modern R packages for network data. Graph
Data setup and manipulation is done in tidygraph and graph visualization
with ggraph.

-   `tidygraph` Data -> "Network Object" in R.
-   `ggraph` Network Object -> Plots using a chosen layout/algo.

Both leverage the power of **`igraph`**, which is the **Big Daddy** of
all network packages. We will be using the Grey's Anatomy dataset in our
first foray into networks.

### Step1. Read the data

Download these two datasets into your current project-\> data folder.

{{< downloadthis "files/data/grey_nodes.csv" dname="grey_nodes" label="Grey’s Anatomy Nodes" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

{{< downloadthis "files/data/grey_edges.csv" dname="grey_edges" label="Grey’s Anatomy Edges" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

```{r}
#| label:  1.Read-greys-anatomy-data
#| message: false
#| column: body-outset-right
#| layout-nrow: 2

grey_nodes <- read_csv("files/data/grey_nodes.csv")
grey_edges <- read_csv("files/data/grey_edges.csv")

grey_nodes
grey_edges

```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #1

Look at the output thumbnails. What attributes (i.e. extra information)
are seen for Nodes and Edges?
:::

### Step 2.Create a network object using tidygraph:

Key function:

-   `tbl_graph()`: (aka "tibble graph"). Key arguments: `nodes`, `edges`
    and `directed`. Note this is a very versatile command and can take
    many input forms, such as data structures that result from other
    packages. Type `?tbl_graph` in the Console and see the `Usage`
    section.

```{r}
#| label:  2.Create-greys-anatomy-graph-object

ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = grey_nodes, 
                edges = grey_edges, 
                directed = FALSE)
ga

```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #2

What information does the graph object contain? What attributes do the
nodes have? What about the edges?
:::

### Step 3. Plot using `ggraph`

3a. Quick Plot: `autograph()` This is to check quickly is the data is
imported properly and to decide upon going on to a more elaborate
plotting.

```{r}
#| label:  3a.Auto-graph-grey-anatomy
autograph(ga)

```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #3

Describe this graph, in simple words here. Try to use some of the new
domain words we have just acquired: nodes/edges, connected/disconnected,
directed/undirected.
:::

3b. More elaborate plot

Key functions:

-   `ggraph(layout = "......")`: Create classic node-edge diagrams; i.e.
    Sets up the graph. Rather like `ggplot` for networks!

Two kinds of `geom`: one set for nodes, and another for edges

-   `geom_node_point(aes(.....))`: Draws node as "points". Alternatives
    are `circle / arc_bar / tile / voronoi`. Remember the `geom`s that
    we have seen before in Grammar of Graphics!

-   `geom_edge_link0(aes(.....))`: Draws edges as "links". Alternatives
    are
    `arc / bend / elbow / hive / loop / parallel / diagonal / point / span /tile`.

-   `geom_node_text(aes(label = ......), repel = TRUE)`: Adds text
    labels (non-overlapping). Alternatives are `label /...`

-   `labs(title = "....", subtitle = "....", caption = "....")`: Change
    main titles, axis labels and legend titles. We know this from our
    work with `ggplot`.

```{r}
#| label:  3b.Ggraph-greys-anatomy

# Write Comments next to each line 
# About what that line does for the overall graph

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") +
  #
  geom_edge_link0(width = 2, color = "pink") +
  #
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8,
                  fill = "blue",
                  color = "green",
                  stroke = 2) +
  
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My First Silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did I ever get in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other classes...\n And the show is even more cool!") +
  
  set_graph_style(family = "Roboto")

```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #4:

What parameters have been changed here, compared to the earlier graph?
Where do you see these changes in the code above?
:::

Let us **Play** with this graph and see if we can make some small
changes. Colour? Fill? Width? Size? Stroke? Labs? Of course!

```{r}
#| label:  3c.Modify-Greys-Anatomy-ggraph
# Change the parameters in each of the commands here to new ones
# Use fixed values for colours or sizes...etc. 

ggraph(graph = ga,  layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link0(width = 2) + 
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 4, 
                  fill = "moccasin", 
                  color = "firebrick", 
                  stroke = 2) +
  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My next silly Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did I ever get in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other classes...") + 
set_graph_style(family = "Roboto")

```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #5

What did the `shape` parameter achieve? What are the possibilities with
`shape`? How about including `alpha`?
:::

3c. Aesthetic Mapping from Node and Edge attribute columns

Up to now, we have **assigned** *specific numbers* to geometric
aesthetics such as shape and size. Now we are ready ( maybe ?) change
the meaning and significance of the entire graph and each element within
it, and use **aesthetics / metaphoric mappings** to achieve new meanings
or insights. Let us try using `aes()` inside each `geom` to map a
`variable` to a geometric aspect.

Don't try to use more than 2 aesthetic mappings simultaneously!!

The node elements we can tweak are:

-   Types of Nodes: `geom_node_****()`\
-   Node Parameters: inside `geom_node_****(aes(...............))`\
    -`aes(alpha  = node-variable)` : opacity; a value between 0 and 1\
    -`aes(shape  = node-variable)` : node shape\
    -`aes(colour = node-variable)` : node colour\
    -`aes(fill   = node-variable)` : fill colour for node\
    -`aes(size   = node-variable)` : size of node

The edge elements we can tweak are:

-   Type of Edges" `geom_edge_****()`\
-   Edge Parameters: inside `geom_edge_****(aes(...............))`\
    -`aes(colour = edge-variable)` : colour of the edge\
    -`aes(width  = edge-variable)` : width of the edge\
    -`aes(label  = some_variable)` : labels for the edge

Type `?geom_node_point` and `?geom-edge_link` in your Console for more
information.

```{r}
#| label:  3d.aesthetics-using-ggraph-Modify

ggraph(graph = ga, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight)) + # change variable here
  
  geom_node_point(aes(color = race), size = 6) + # change variable here

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! Yet another Grey's Anatomy graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Colouring Nodes by Attribute",
       caption = "Grey's Anatomy") +
  
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,2)) +
  set_graph_style(family = "roboto")


```

::: callout-note
## Questions and Inferences #6

Describe some of the changes here. What types of edges worked? Which
variables were you able to use for nodes and edges and how? What did not
work with either of the two?

How do graphs look "metaphorically" different? Do they reveal different
aspects of the group? How?

## Faceting

Faceting allows to create sub-plots according to the values of a
qualitative attribute on nodes or edges.

```{r}
#| label:  faceting
#| column: body-outset-right
#| layout-ncol: 2
##
set_graph_style(family = "Roboto",size = 8)
##
# facet edges by type
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link0(aes(color = type)) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_edges(~ type) +
  th_foreground(border = TRUE) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)

# facet nodes by sex
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link0() + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_nodes(~race) +
  th_foreground(border = TRUE) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)


# facet both nodes and edges
ggraph(ga,layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) + 
  geom_edge_link0(aes(color = type)) + 
  geom_node_point() +
  facet_graph(type ~ race) + 
  th_foreground(border = TRUE) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = "right")

Does splitting up the main graph into sub-networks give you more
insight? Describe some of these.

## Network analysis with tidygraph

The data frame graph representation can be easily augmented with
**metrics** or **statistics** computed on the graph. Remember how we
computed `counts` with the penguin dataset in Grammar of Graphics.

Before computing a metric on nodes or edges use the `activate()`
function to activate either node or edge data frames. Use `dplyr`
**verbs** (`filter, arrange, mutate`) to achieve your computation in the
proper way.

### Network Centrality: Go-To and Go-Through People!

Centrality is a an "ill-defined" metric of **node and edge importance**
in a network. It is therefore calculated in many ways. Type
`?centrality` in your Console.

![Standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png){fig-align="center"}

Let's add a few columns to the nodes and edges based on network
centrality measures:

```{r}
#| label:  network-analysis-1

ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  
  # Node with  the most connections?
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = c("in"))) %>% 
  filter(degree > 0) %>% 
  
  activate(edges) %>% 
  # "Busiest" edge?
  mutate(betweenness = centrality_edge_betweenness())

```

Packages `tidygraph` and `ggraph` can be pipe-lined to perform analysis
and visualization tasks in one go.

```{r Using-Centrality}
##
set_graph_style(family = "Roboto")
##
ggraph(ga,layout = "nicely") +
    geom_edge_link0(aes(alpha = centrality_edge_betweenness())) + 
    
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = centrality_degree(), 
                        size = centrality_degree())) +
    
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 1.5) +
    
    scale_size(name = "Degree", range = c(0.5, 5)) + 
    
    scale_color_gradient(name = "Degree", # SAME NAME!!
                         low = "blue", high = "red", 
                         aesthetics = c("colour", "fill"), 
                         guide = guide_legend(reverse = FALSE)) + 
    
    scale_edge_alpha(name = "Betweenness", range = c(0.05, 1)) +
    labs(title = "Grey's Anatomy", 
         subtitle = "Nodes Scaled by Degree, Edges shaded by Betweenness")

```

## Questions and Inferences #11 

How do the Centrality Measures show up in the graph? Would you "agree"
with the way we have done it? Try to modify the aesthetics by
copy-pasting this chunk below and see how you can make an alternative
representation.

### Analysis and Visualizing Network Communities

Who is close to whom? Which are the groups you can see?

```{r}
#| label: communities in networks
##
set_graph_style(family = "Roboto")
##
# visualize communities of nodes
ga %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_louvain())) %>% 
  ggraph(layout = "graphopt") + 
  geom_edge_link0() + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = community), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Grey's Anatomy", subtitle = "Nodes Coloured by Community Detection Algorithm (Louvain)")


```

aesthetic? Copy Paste this chunk below and try.

### Interactive Graphs with `visNetwork`

Exploring the `VisNetwork` package. Make graphs wiggle and shake using
`tidy` commands! The package implements interactivity using the physical
metaphor of weights and springs we discussed earlier.

The `visNetwork()` function uses a nodes list and edges list to create
an interactive graph. The nodes list must include an "id" column, and
the edge list must have "from" and "to" columns. The function also plots
the labels for the nodes, using the names of the cities from the "label"
column in the node list.

```{r}
#| label:  greys-anatomy-data-for-visnetwork
#| layout-ncol: 2

library(visNetwork)

# Prepare the data for plotting by visNetwork
grey_nodes
grey_edges

# Relabel greys anatomy nodes and edges for VisNetwork
grey_nodes_vis <- grey_nodes %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  rename("label" = name) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "F" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "M" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  replace_na(., list(sex = "Transgender?")) %>% 
  rename("group" = sex)
grey_nodes_vis

grey_edges_vis <- grey_edges %>% 
  select(from, to) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("from" = "label")) %>% 
  left_join(., grey_nodes_vis, 
            by = c("to" = "label")) %>%
  select("from"= id.x, "to" = id.y)
grey_edges_vis

```

Using [fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons)

```{r}
#| label:  greys-anatomy-visNetwork
grey_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 40)) %>% 
  
  # Colour and icons for each of the gender-groups
  visGroups(groupname = "Female", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f182", size = 75, color = "tomato"),
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Male", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f183", size = 75, color = "slateblue"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  visGroups(groupname = "Transgender?", shape = "icon", 
            icon = list(code = "f22c", size = 75, color = "fuchsia"), 
            shadow = list(enabled = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  #visLegend() %>%
  #Add the fontawesome icons!!
  addFontAwesome(version = "4.7.0") %>% 
  
  # Add Interaction Controls
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE,
                 hover = TRUE,
                 selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
                 zoomView = TRUE)
```

There is another family of icons available in `visNetwork`, called
[`ionicons`](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/cheatsheet.html).
Let's see how they look:

```{r}
#| label:  using-ionicons
grey_nodes_vis %>%

  visNetwork(nodes = ., edges = grey_edges_vis,) %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 12345) %>%
  visNodes(font = list(size = 50)) %>%
  visEdges(color = "green") %>%
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Female",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f25d",
      color = "fuchsia",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Male",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f202",
      color = "green",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  
  visGroups(
    groupname = "Transgender?",
    shape = "icon",
    icon = list(
      face = 'Ionicons',
      code = "f233",
      color = "dodgerblue",
      size = 125
    )
  ) %>%
  visLegend() %>%
  addIonicons() %>%
  visInteraction(
    navigationButtons = TRUE,
    hover = TRUE,
    selectConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    hoverConnectedEdges = TRUE,
    zoomView = TRUE
  )
```

Some idea of interactivity and controls with `visNetwork`:

{{< downloadthis "files/data/star-wars-network-edges.csv" dname="star_wars_edges" label="Star Wars Edges" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

```{r}
#| label:  visNetwork-starwars-1

# let's look again at the data
starwars_nodes <- read_csv("files/data/star-wars-network-nodes.csv")
starwars_edges <- read_csv("files/data/star-wars-network-edges.csv")

```

```{r}
#| label:  visNetwork-starwars-2
#| layout-ncol: 2

# We need to rename starwars nodes dataframe and edge dataframe columns for visNetwork
starwars_nodes_vis <- 
  starwars_nodes %>% 
  rename("label" = name)

# Convert from and to columns to **node ids**
starwars_edges_vis <- 
  starwars_edges %>% 
  
  # Matching Source <- Source Node id ("id.x")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("source" = "label")) %>% 
  
  # Matching Target <- Target Node id ("id.y")
  left_join(., starwars_nodes_vis, by = c("target" = "label")) %>% 
  
# Select "id.x" and "id.y" ONLY
# Rename them as "from" and "to"
# keep "weight" column for aesthetics of edges
  select("from" = id.x, "to" = id.y, "value" = weight)

# Check everything once
starwars_nodes_vis
starwars_edges_vis

```

Ok, let's make things move and shake!!

```{r}
#| label:  visNetwork-starwars

visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  visEdges(color = "red")

```


```{r}
#| label:  visNetwork-starwars-futbol-interaction

visNetwork(nodes = starwars_nodes_vis,
           edges = starwars_edges_vis) %>% 
  visNodes(font = list(size = 30), shape = "icon", 
           icon = list(code = "f1e3", size = 75)) %>% 
  visEdges(color = list(color = "red", hover = "green", highlight = "black")) %>% 
  visInteraction(hover = TRUE) %>% 
  addFontAwesome(version = "4.7.0")

```

### The Famous Zachary Karate Club dataset

- Start with pulling this data into your Quarto:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false ## remove this!
data("karate",package= "igraphdata")
karate
```
-   Try `?karate` in the console\
-   Note that this is **not** a set of nodes, nor edges, **but** already
    a **graph-object**!\
-   So no need to create a graph object using `tbl_graph`.\
-   You will need to just go ahead and plot using `ggraph`.

```{r}
#| label: start-up code for GoT
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false ## remove this!!

GoT <- read_rds("data/GoT.RDS")

```

-   Note that this is a **list** of **7** graphs from Game of Thrones.
-   Select one using `GoT[[index]]` where index = 1...7 and then plot
    directly.
-   Try to access the nodes and edges and modify them using any
    attribute data

    details in other columns to the right.\
  -   In your `edges` excel, use `from` and `to` as your first columns.\
  -   Entries in these columns can be `names` or `id`s but be consistent
    and don't mix.\

- Step 3. Decide on 3 answers that you to seek and plan to make graphs
for.\
- Step 4. Create graph objects. Say 3 visualizations.\
- Step 5. Write comments/answers in the code and narrative text. Add
pictures from the web using Markdown syntax.\
- Step 6. Write Reflection ( ok, a short one!) *inside* your Quarto
document. Make sure it renders !!\
