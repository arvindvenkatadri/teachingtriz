Dumbbell and Radar Charts for Ranking

:::



What do we see here? From <https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/americas-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-2024/> : 

From @fig-electricity-sources:

- `Onshore wind power` effectively costs USD0 per megawatt-hour (MWh) when subsidies are included!\
- Demand for storage solutions is rising quickly. If storage is included, the minimum cost for `onshore wind` increases to $8 per MWh.\
- Solar photovoltaics (PV) have similarly attractive economics. With subsidies, the minimum cost is USD6 per MWh. When including storage, USD38 per MWh. Notably, the maximum cost of solar PV with storage has significantly increased from USD102 in 2023 to USD 210 in 2024.\
- For gas-combined cycle plants, which combine natural gas and steam turbines for efficient electricity generation, the maximum price has climbed $7 year-over-year to $108 per MWh.\

And from From @fig-baseball-5tools?

- There is a clear difference in the capabilities of the three players compared, though all of them are classified as "5 tools" players. \
- Each player is better than the others at one unique skill: Betts at `Throwing`, Judge at `Hit_power`, and Trout at `Hit_avg`.\

## {{< iconify fxemoji japanesesymbolforbeginner >}} What graphs are we going to see today?

When we wish to compare the size of things and rank them, there are
quite a few ways to do it.

Bar Charts and Lollipop Charts are immediately obvious when we wish to
rank things on *one aspect or parameter*, e.g. mean income vs education. We can also *put two lollipop charts back-to-back* to make a Dumbbell Chart to show comparisons/ranks across *two datasets* based on *one aspect*, e.g change in mean income over two years, across gender.
 
When we wish to rank the *multiple objects* against *multiple aspects or parameters*, then we can use Bump Charts and Radar Charts, e.g performance of one or more products against multiple criteria (cost, size, performance...)s.


## {{< iconify openmoji poppy >}} Lollipop Charts

Let's make a toy dataset of Products and Ratings:

```{r}
# Sample data set
set.seed(1)
df1 <- tibble(product = LETTERS[1:10],
              rank = sample(20:35, 10, replace = TRUE))
df1

```


::: column-page-inset-right

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Using ggformula

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
#| label: lollipop-1
#| eval: false

ggplot2::theme_set(new = theme_classic(base_family = "Roboto Condensed")) # Set consistent graph theme

###
gf_segment(0 + rank ~ product + product, data = df1) %>% 
# A formula with shape y + yend ~ x + xend.
  
  gf_point(rank ~ product, colour = ~ product, 
           size = 5,
           ylab = "Rank",
           xlab = "Product") 
```
:::

::: {.column}
```{r}
#| ref.label: lollipop-1

```
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
#| label: lollipop-2
#| eval: false
ggplot2::theme_set(new = theme_classic(base_family = "Roboto Condensed")) # Set consistent graph theme

###
gf_segment(0 + rank ~ fct_reorder(product, - rank) + 
             fct_reorder(product, - rank), 
           data = df1) %>%
  # A formula with shape y + yend ~ x + xend.
  
  gf_point(rank ~ product, colour = ~ product, size = 5) %>%
  
  gf_refine(coord_flip()) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Product", y = "Rank") 

```
:::

::: {.column}
```{r}
#| ref.label: lollipop-2
#| echo: false

:::

::::

We have flipped the chart horizontally *and* reordered the $x$ categories in order of decreasing ( or increasing ) $y$, using `forcats::fct_reorder`.


### Using ggplot

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

ggplot2::theme_set(new = theme_classic(base_family = "Roboto Condensed")) # Set consistent graph theme

###
ggplot(df1) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, yend = rank, 
                   x = product, 
                   xend = product)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = rank, x = product, colour = product), size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Product Ratings", x = "Product", y = "Rank")

###
ggplot(df1) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, yend = rank, 
                   x = fct_reorder(product, -rank),
                   xend = fct_reorder(product, -rank)))  +
  geom_point(aes(x = product, y = rank, colour = product), size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Product Ratings", x = "Product", y = "Rank")  +
  coord_flip()
 
```

### Using ggalt

Yes, R has ( nearly) everything, including a `geom_lollipop` command: Here!

### Business Insights from Lollipop Plots

- Very simple chart, almost like a bar chart
- Differences between the same set of data across one *aspect* (i.e. rank) is very quickly apparent
- *Ordering* the dataset by the attribute (i.e ordering product by rank) makes the message very clear.
- Even a large number of data can safely be visualized and understood

## {{< iconify solar dumbbells-bold >}} Dumbbell Charts

A lollipop chart compares a set of data against *one aspect*. What if we have more than one? Say sales in many product lines *across two years*?

Let us once again construct a very similar looking toy dataset, but with *two* columns for ratings, one for each of two years:

```{r}
# Sample data set
# Wide Format data!
set.seed(2)
df2 <- tibble(product = LETTERS[1:10],
              rank_year1 = sample(20:35, 10, replace = TRUE),
              rank_year2 = sample(15:45, 10, replace = TRUE))
df2

```


:::{.hidden}
A short diversion: we can also make this data into long form: this will become useful very shortly!

::: callout-note

### {{< iconify icon-park pivot-table >}} Wide Form and Long Form Data

Look at the data: this is **wide form data**. The columns pertaining to each of the Product-Features would normally be stacked into two columns, one with the Feature and the other with the score. Note the trio: Qual(product) + Qual(year) + Quant(scores):

```{r}
# With Long Format Data
df2_long <- df2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(dplyr::starts_with("rank")), 
               names_to = "year", values_to = "scores")
df2_long

```

A cool visualization of this operation was created by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/):

- Differences between the same set of data at two different *aspects* is very quickly apparent
- *Differences in differences(DID)* are also quite easily apparent. Experiments do use these metrics and these plots would be very useful there. 
- `ggalt` works nicely with additional visible guides rendered in the chart

## {{< iconify teenyicons curved-connector-outline >}} Bump Charts

Bump Charts track the ranking of several objects based on *other*
parameters, such as time/month or even category. For instance, what is the opinion score of a set of products across various categories of users?

```{r}
year <- rep(2019:2021, 4)
position <- c(4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3)
product <- c("A", "A", "A",
            "B", "B", "B", 
            "C", "C", "C",
            "D", "D", "D")

df3 <- tibble(year,position,product)

### `ggbump` uses `ggplot` syntax

We need to use a new package called, what else, `ggbump` to create our
`Bump Charts`: Here again we do not yet have a `ggformula` equivalent. ( Though it may be possible with a combination of `gf_point` and `gf_polygon`, and pre-computing the coordinates. Seems long-winded.)

Note the `+` syntax with `ggplot` code!!

### Business Insights from Bump Charts

- Bump charts are good for depicting Ranks/Scores pertaining to a set of data, as they vary over another *aspect*, for a set of products
- Cannot have too many levels in the *aspect* parameter, else the graph gets too hard to make sense with.
- For instance if we had 10 years in the data above, we would have lost the plot, literally! Perhaps better to use a Sankey in that case!!

## {{< iconify ant-design radar-chart-outlined >}} Radar Charts

What if your marketing folks had rated some products along several
different desirable criteria? Such data, where a certain set of items
(Qualitative!!) are **rated** (Quantitative!) against another set
(Qualitative again!!) can be plotted on a roughly *circular set of axes*,
with the *radial distance* defining the rank against each axes. Such a plot is called a *radar plot*. 

Of course, we will use the aptly named `ggradar`, which is at this time
(Feb 2023) a development version and not yet part of CRAN. We will still
try it, and another package `ggiraphExtra` which IS a part of CRAN (and
has some other capabilities too, which are worth exploring!)

Let us generate some toy data first:

```{r using ggradar}

set.seed(4)
df4 <- tibble(Product = c("G1", "G2", "G3"),
              Power = runif(3), 
              Cost = runif(3),
              Harmony = runif(3),
              Style = runif(3),
              Size = runif(3),
              Manufacturability = runif(3),
              Durability = runif(3),
              Universality = runif(3))
df4

```

And now plot it with both packages.

### Business Insights from Radar Plots

- Differences in scores for a given item across several *aspect* or parameters are readily apparent.
- These can also be compared, parameter for parameter, with more than one item
- the same set of data at two different *aspects* is very quickly apparent
- Data is clearly in *wide* form
- Both `ggradar` and `ggiraphExtra` render very similar-looking radar charts and the syntax is not too intimidating!!

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Bump Charts can show changes in Rating and Ranking over time, or some other Qual variable too!
- Lollipop Charts are useful in *comparing* multiple say products or services, with only one **aspect for comparison**, or which defines the rank
- Radar Charts are also useful in comparing multiple say products or services, but against **several aspects or parameters** for simultaneous comparisons.

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion
- These are easy and simple charts to use and are easily understood too
- Bear in mind the *data structure* requirements for different charts/packages: Wide vs Long.


## {{< iconify icon-park me >}} Your Turn

1.  Take the `HELPrct` dataset from our well used `mosaicData` package.
    Plot ranking charts using each of the public health issues that you
    can see in that dataset. What choice will you make for the the axes?
2.  Try the `SaratogaHouses` dataset also from `mosaicData`.
