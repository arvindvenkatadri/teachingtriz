### `mosaic` and `ggformula` command template

Note the standard method for all commands from the `mosaic` and
`ggformula` packages: `goal( y ~ x | z, data = _____)`

With `ggformula`, one can create any graph/chart using:
`gf_***(y ~ x | z, data = _____)`

In practice, we often use: `dataframe %>%  gf_***(y ~ x | z)` which has
cool benefits such as "autocompletion" of variable names, as we shall
see. The "\*\*\*" indicates what kind of graph you desire: histogram,
bar, scatter, density; the "\_\_\_" is the name of your dataset that you
want to plot with.
:::

::: callout-tip
### `ggplot` command template

The `ggplot`2 template is used to identify the dataframe, identify the x
and y axis, and define visualized layers:

`ggplot(data = ---, mapping = aes(x = ---, y = ---)) + geom_----()`

Note: ---- is meant to imply text you supply. e.g. function names, data
frame names, variable names.

It is helpful to see the argument mapping, above. In practice, rather
than typing the formal arguments, code is typically shorthanded to this:

`dataframe %>%  ggplot(aes(xvar, yvar)) + geom_----()`

## {{< iconify openmoji japanese-symbol-for-beginner >}} Introduction

Any metric that is measured over regular time intervals forms a **time
series**. Analysis of Time Series is commercially important because of
industrial need and relevance, especially with respect to Forecasting
(Weather data, sports scores, population growth figures, stock prices,
demand, sales, supply...). For example, in the graph shown below are the
temperatures over time in two US cities:

<iframe width="100%" height="514" frameborder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/f274bd3d517cf495?cells=LineChart">

</iframe>

What can we do with Time Series? As with other datasets, we have to
begin by answering fundamental questions, such as:

1.  What are the **types** of time series?
2.  How do we **visualize** time series?
3.  How might we **summarize** time series to get aggregate numbers, say
    by week, month, quarter or year?
4.  How do we **decompose** the time series into level, trend, and
    seasonal components?
5.  How might we make a **model** of the underlying process that creates
    these time series?
6.  How do we make useful **forecasts** with the data we have?

We will first look at the **multiple data formats** for time series in
R. Alongside we will look at the R packages that work with these formats
and create graphs and measures using those objects. Then we examine
*data wrangling* of time series, where we look at packages that offer
`dplyr`-like ability to group and summarize time series using the `time`
variable. We will finally look at obtaining the components of the time
series and try our hand at modelling and forecasting.

## {{< iconify game-icons time-synchronization >}} {{< iconify flat-color-icons line-chart >}} Time Series Formats, Conversion, and Plotting

There are multiple formats for time series data. The ones that we are
likely to encounter most are:

-   [The **ts** format]{.underline}: We may simply have a single series
    of measurements that are made over time, stored as a **numerical
    vector**. The `stats::ts()` function will convert a numeric vector
    into an R time series `ts` object, which is the most basic time
    series object in R. The base-R `ts` object is used by established
    packages `forecast` and is also supported by newer packages such as
    `tsbox`.

-   [The **tibble** format]{.underline}: the simplest and most familiar
    data format is of course the standard tibble/data frame, with or
    without an explicit `time` column/variable to indicate that the
    other variables vary with time. The standard tibble object is used
    by many packages, e.g. `timetk` & `modeltime`.

-   [The **tsibble** format]{.underline}: this is a new format for time
    series analysis. The special `tsibble` object ("time series tibble")
    is used by `fable`, `feasts` and others from the
    [`tidyverts`](https://tidyverts.org/) set of packages.

There are many other `time-oriented` data formats too...[probably too
many](https://xkcd.com/927), such a `tibbletime` and `TimeSeries`
objects. For now the best way to deal with these, should you encounter
them, is to convert them (Using the package
[tsbox](https://docs.ropensci.org/tsbox/)) to a `tibble` or a `tsibble`
and work with these.

![Standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png){fig-align="center"}

To start, we will use simple `ts` data first, and then do another with a "vanilla" `tibble` format that we can plot *as is*. We will then look at a `tibble`data that *does have a time-oriented variable*. We will then perform
conversion to `tsibble` format to plot it, and then a final example with a
ground-up `tsibble` dataset.

### {{< iconify vaadin hourglass-start >}} Base-R `ts` format data

There are a few datasets in base R that are in `ts` format already.

```{r ts-data}

AirPassengers
str(AirPassengers)

```

This can be easily plotted using base R:

```{r}
#| label: base-R-ts-plot
#| message: false

# Base R
plot(AirPassengers)

```

One can see that there is an upward *trend* and also *seasonal
variations* that also increase over time. This is an example of a
*multiplicative* time series, which we will discuss later.

Let us take data that is "time oriented" but not in `ts` format. We use
the command `ts` to convert a numeric vector to `ts` format: the syntax
of `ts()` is:

Syntax: `objectName <- ts(data, start, end, frequency)`, where,

-   `data` : represents the data vector
-   `start` : represents the first observation in time series
-   `end` : represents the last observation in time series
-   `frequency` : represents number of observations per unit time. For
    example *1=annual, 4=quarterly, 12=monthly, 7=weekly*, etc.

We will pick simple **numerical vector data** ( i.e. not a time series )
`ChickWeight`:

```{r}
#| label: ts using stats-ts

ChickWeight %>% head()

# Filter for Chick #1 and for Diet #1
ChickWeight_ts <- ChickWeight %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Chick == 1, Diet ==1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(weight, Time)

# stats::ts does not accept pipe format
ChickWeight_ts <- stats::ts(ChickWeight_ts$weight, frequency = 2) 
str(ChickWeight_ts)

plot(ChickWeight_ts) # Using base-R

```

We see that the weights of a young chick specimen #1 increases over time.

### {{< iconify mdi table-clock >}} `tibble` data

The `ts` data format can handle *only one time series*; in the above
example, we could not have plotted the weight of two chicks, if we had
wanted to. If we want to plot/analyze multiple time series, based on say
*Qualitative* variables, (e.g. sales figures over time across multiple
*products* and *locations*) we need other data formats. Using the familiar
`tibble` structure opens up new possibilities.\

-   We can have **multiple** **time series** within a tibble (think of
    numerical time-series data like `GDP`, `Population`, `Imports`,
    `Exports` for multiple countries as with the `gapminder`[^1]data we
    saw earlier).\
-   It also allows for data processing with `dplyr` such as filtering
    and summarizing.\

::: column-margin
#### `gapminder` data

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% select(country, year, gdpPercap, pop, lifeExp, everything())

```
:::

Let us read and inspect in the `US births data` from 2000 to 2014.
Download this data by clicking on the icon below, and saving the
downloaded file in a sub-folder called `data` inside your project.

{{< downloadthis data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv dname="US_births_2000-2014_SSA" label="Download the US Births data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

Read this data in and inspect it.

```{r}
#| label: using-tibble-data-1
#| message: false

births_2000_2014 <- read_csv("data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv")
glimpse(births_2000_2014)
inspect(births_2000_2014)
skim(births_2000_2014)
births_2000_2014

```

This is just a `tibble` containing a single data variable `births` that
varies over time. All other variables, although depicting time, are
*numerical columns* and not explicitly *time columns*. There are no
Qualitative variables (yet!).

#### Plotting `tibble`-oriented time data

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
##### Using ggformula

We will now plot this using `ggformula`. Using the separate
`year/month/week` and `day_of_week / day_of_month` columns, we can plot
births over time, colouring by `day_of_week`, for example:

```{r}
#| label: using ggformula
#| layout-ncol: 2

# grouping by day_of_week
births_2000_2014 %>% 
  gf_line(births ~ year, 
          group = ~ day_of_week, 
          color = ~ day_of_week) %>% 
  gf_point(title = "Births, By Day of Week", 
           subtitle = "Over the Years") %>% 
  gf_theme(scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Paired")) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())


# Grouping by date_of_month
births_2000_2014 %>% 
  gf_line(births ~ year, 
          group = ~ date_of_month, 
          color = ~ date_of_month) %>% 
  gf_point(title = "Births, By Date of Month",
           subtitle = "Over the Years") %>% 
  gf_theme(scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Paired")) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())


```

Not particularly illuminating. This is because the data is **daily** and
we have considerable variation over time, and here we have too much data
to visualize.

**Summaries** will help, so we could calculate the the **mean births per
month** in each year and plot that:

```{r}
#| label: using-tibble-data-3
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

births_2000_2014_monthly <- births_2000_2014 %>% 
  
# Convert month to factor/Qual variable!
# So that we can have discrete colours for each month
# Using base::factor()
# Could use forcats::as_factor() also

  mutate(month = base::factor(month, labels = month.abb)) %>%

# `month.abb` is a built-in dataset containing names of months.

  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarise(mean_monthly_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE))
births_2000_2014_monthly

####
births_2000_2014_monthly %>% 
##
  gf_line(mean_monthly_births ~ year, 
          group = ~ month, 
          colour = ~ month, linewidth = 1) %>% 
##
  gf_point(size = 1.5, 
           title = "Summaries of Monthly Births over the years") %>% 
  
## palette for 12 colours
  gf_theme(scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired")) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())


```

::: callout-note
These are graphs *for the same month each year*: we have a January graph
and a February graph and so on. So...average births per month were
higher in all months during 2005 to 2007 and have dropped since.
:::

We can do similar graphs using `day_of_week` as our basis for grouping,
instead of month:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

births_2000_2014_weekly <- births_2000_2014 %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = base::factor(day_of_week,
          levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7), 
          labels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) %>% 
  group_by(year, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(mean_daily_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE))
##
births_2000_2014_weekly
##
births_2000_2014_weekly %>%   
  gf_line(mean_daily_births ~ year, 
          group = ~ day_of_week, 
          colour = ~ day_of_week, 
          linewidth = 1,
          data = .) %>% 
  gf_point(size = 2, title = "Births over the Years by Day of Week") %>% 
  # palette for 12 colours
  gf_theme(scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired")) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())


```

##### Using ggplot

We will now plot this using `ggplot` for completeness. Using the
separate `year/month/week` and `day_of_week / day_of_month` columns, we
can plot births over time, colouring by `day_of_week`, for example:

```{r}
#| label: using ggplot
#| layout-ncol: 2

# grouping by day_of_week
births_2000_2014 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, births,
             group = day_of_week, 
             color = day_of_week)) + 
  geom_line() +  
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Births, By Day of Week",
       subtitle = "Over the Years") + 
  scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Paired")
##

# Grouping by date_of_month
births_2000_2014 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,births,color = date_of_month,
             group = date_of_month)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Births,By Date of Month",
       subtitle = "Over the Years") + 
  scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Paired") 

```

```{r}
#| label: using-tibble-data-3b
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2

births_2000_2014_monthly <- births_2000_2014 %>% 
  
# Convert month to factor/Qual variable!
# So that we can have discrete colours for each month
# Using base::factor()
# Could use forcats::as_factor() also
  mutate(month = base::factor(month, labels = month.abb)) %>%
# `month.abb` is a built-in dataset containing names of months.

  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarise(mean_monthly_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE))
births_2000_2014_monthly

births_2000_2014_monthly %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_monthly_births,
             group = month, 
             colour = month)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  labs(title = "Summaries of Monthly Births over the years") + 
    
  # palette for 12 colours
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired") + 
  theme_classic()


```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

births_2000_2014_weekly <- births_2000_2014 %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = base::factor(day_of_week,
          levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7), 
          labels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))) %>% 
  group_by(year, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(mean_daily_births = mean(births, na.rm = TRUE))
births_2000_2014_weekly

births_2000_2014_weekly %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_daily_births, 
             group = day_of_week,
             colour = day_of_week)) +

  geom_point(size = 2) +

::: callout-note
### Why are fewer babies born on weekends?

Looks like an interesting story here...there are significantly fewer
births on average on Sat and Sun, over the years! Why? Should we watch
[Grey's Anatomy](https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/greys-anatomy/14823) ?
:::

::: callout-important
Note that this is still using just `tibble` data, without converting it
into a `time series` format. So far we are simply treating the
`year/month/day` variables are simple variables and using `dplyr` to
group and summarize. We have not created an explicit `time` or `date`
variable.
:::

{{< newline >}}

#### Plotting `tibble` time-series

Now, we *can* convert the time-oriented columns in this dataset into a
single `date` variable, giving us a proper tibble time-series:

```{r}
births_tibble_timeseries <- 
  births_2000_2014 %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::make_date( year, month, date_of_month)) %>%

## Drop off the individual columns ( year, month, day_of_month)
  select(date, births)

births_tibble_timeseries

```

Note that we have a proper `date` formatted column, as desired. This is
a single time series, but if we had other Qualitative variables such as
say `city`, we could easily have had multiple series here. We can plot
this with `ggformula/ggplot` as we have done before, and with now with
`timetk`:

```{r}
#| eval: false

births_tibble_timeseries %>%
  gf_line(births ~ date)

births_tibble_timeseries %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, births)) + geom_line()

```

```{r}
#| label: Time-series-timetk
births_tibble_timeseries %>%
  timetk::plot_time_series(.date_var = date, 
                           .value = births, 
                           .interactive = FALSE, 
                           .title = "Births over Time",
                           .x_lab = "Time",
                           .y_lab = "Births")
```

### {{< iconify icon-park database-time >}} `tsibble` data

Finally, we have `tsibble` ("time series tibble") format data, which
contains three main components:

-   an `index` variable that defines **time**;
-   a set of `key` variables, usually **categorical**, that define sets
    of observations, over time. This allows for each combination of the
    categorical variables to define a **separate time series**.
-   a set of **quantitative** variables, that represent the quantities
    that vary with time (i.e `index`)

Here is Robert Hyndman's video introducing tsibbles:

{{< video https://youtu.be/EwjvA2OcdHs >}}

The package `tsibbledata` contains several ready made `tsibble` format
data. [Run `data(package = "tsibbledata")` in your Console to find out
about these.]{.aside} Let us try `PBS`, which is a dataset containing
Monthly Medicare prescription data in Australia.

```{r}
#| label: PBS
#| message: true
data(PBS, package = "tsibbledata")
PBS
glimpse(PBS)

```

[Data Description:]{.underline} This is a large-ish dataset:[Run `PBS`
in your console]{.aside}

-   67K observations
-   336 combinations of `key` variables (`Concession`, `Type`, `ATC1`,
    `ATC2`) which are categorical, as foreseen.
-   Data appears to be *monthly,* as indicated by the `1M`.
-   the time index variable is called `Month`, formatted as `yearmonth`,
    a new type of variable introduced in the `tsibble` package.

Note that there are multiple **Quantitative variables**
(`Scripts`,`Cost`), each sliced into 336 time-series, a feature which is
not supported in the `ts` format, but is supported in a `tsibble`. The
**Qualitative Variables** are described below. [Type `help("PBS")` in
your Console.]{.aside}

The data is dis-aggregated/grouped using four `keys`:\
- `Concession`: Concessional scripts are given to pensioners,
unemployed, dependents, and other card holders\
- `Type`: Co-payments are made until an individual's script expenditure
hits a threshold (\$290.00 for concession, \$1141.80 otherwise). Safety
net subsidies are provided to individuals exceeding this amount.\
- `ATC1`: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical index (level 1). 15 types\
- `ATC2`: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical index (level 2). 84 types,
nested inside `ATC1`.

Let us simply plot `Cost` over time:

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
### Using ggformula

```{r}
#| label:  PBS-Cost-ggformula

PBS %>%
  gf_point(Cost ~ Month, data = .) %>% 
  gf_line(title = "PBS Costs vs time", caption = "ggformula") %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())

```

### Using ggplot

```{r}
#| label:  PBS-Cost-ggplot

PBS %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Month, Cost)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "PBS Costs vs time", caption = "ggplot") + 
  theme_classic()

```

### Using timetk

```{r}
PBS %>%
  timetk::plot_time_series(.date_var = Month, .value = Cost, 
                           .interactive = FALSE,
                           .smooth = FALSE)
```
:::

This basic plot is quite messy. Other than an overall rising trend and
more vigorous variations pointing to a multiplicative process, we
cannot say more. There is simply too much happening here and it is now
time (sic!) for us to look at summaries of the data using `dplyr`-like
verbs.

We will do that in the @sec-slides-and-tutorials.

## {{< iconify carbon heat-map-03 >}} Time Series Heatmaps

How about a heatmap? We can cook up a categorical variable based on the
number of births (low, fine, high) and use that to create a heatmap:

```{r}

births_2000_2014 %>%
  mutate(birthrate = case_when(births >= 10000 ~ "high",
                               births <= 8000 ~ "low",
                               TRUE ~ "fine")) %>%
  mutate(birthrate = base::factor(birthrate, 
                                  labels = c("high", "fine", "low"), 
                                  ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  
  gf_tile(
    data = .,
    year ~ month,
    fill = ~ birthrate,
    color = "black"
  ) %>%
  
  gf_theme(scale_x_time(
    breaks = 1:12,
    labels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr",
               "May","Jun","Jul","Aug",
               "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")
  )) %>%
  
  gf_theme(scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "OrRd", direction = -1)) %>% 
  gf_theme(theme_classic())

```

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

We have seen a good few data formats for time series, and how to work
with them and plot them.

In the Tutorial @sec-slides-and-tutorials, we will explore:

-   wrangling with Time series to produce grouped and filtered
    aggregates/summaries and plots with these
-   how to decompose time series into periodic and aperiodic components,
    which can be used to make business decisions.
-   Producing Interactive Plots for Time Series
-   **modelling** and **forecasting** of time series.
