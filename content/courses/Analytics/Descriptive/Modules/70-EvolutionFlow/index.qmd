## {{< iconify entypo line-graph >}} What Time Evolution Charts can we plot?

In these cases, the x-axis is typically *time*...and we chart the
variable of another Quant variable with respect to time, using a *line*
geometry.

Let is take a healthcare budget dataset from [Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID):
We will plot graphs for 5 countries (India, China, Brazil, Russia,
Canada ).

### And Introducting `echarts4r`
We will also build interactive versions of these charts using `echarts4r`!

## {{< iconify carbon sankey-diagram-alt >}} What Space Evolution Charts can we plot?

Here, the *space* can be any Qual variable, and we can chart another
Quant or Qual variable move across levels of the first chosen Qual
variable.

For instance we can contemplate enrollment at a University, and show how
students move from course to course in a University. Or how customers
drift from one category of products or brands to another....or the
movement of cricket players from one IPL Team to another !!

Here is what [Thomas Lin
Pedersen](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_parallel_sets.html)
says:

> A **parallel sets diagram** is a type of visualisation showing the
> interaction between multiple categorical variables. If the variables
> have an **intrinsic order** the representation can be thought of as a
> **Sankey Diagram**. If each variable is a point in time it will
> resemble an **Alluvial diagram**.

Geometric Aesthetics from two Sankey Plot Packages
:::


-   The Qualitative variables being connected are mapped to
    `stages/axes`
-   Each *level* within a Qual variable is mapped to
    `nodes / strata / lodes`;
-   And the connections between the `strata` of the `axes` are called
    `flows / edges / links / alluvia`.\

Such diagrams are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping
between two domains or multiple paths through a set of stages E.g
`Students` pursruing different `degrees` going through multiple `courses` with multiple `departments` during a semester of study. Here `students`, `degrees`, `courses`, `departments` would be some variables we would plot and we would visualize the number of students moving across `courses` and `deparments` based on their `degree` etc. 

Here is an example of a Sankey Diagram: This diagram show how energy is
converted or transmitted before being consumed or lost: supplies are on
the left, and demands are on the right. (Data: Department of Energy &
Climate Change via Tom Counsell)[^1]:

## Table Form Data

Note that this data is in **tidy wide** / **table** form, with separate
columns for each Qualitative variable and a separate `count` column,
which we saw when we examined Categorical Data. This is, in my opinion,
intuitively the best form of data to plot a Sankey plot with. Each variable gives us "**one part in the flow**". But there
are other forms such as the **tidy long** form which we have been using
practically all this while. You will find examples of on the
`ggalluvial` website using **tidy long** form data.

> Here is how the package `ggalluvial` defines the elements of a typical
> alluvial plot:
>
> -   An **axis** is a dimension (variable) along which the data are
>     vertically arranged at a fixed horizontal position. The plot above
>     uses three categorical axes: Class, Sex, and Age.
> -   The groups at each axis are depicted as opaque blocks called
>     **strata**. For example, the Class axis contains four strata: 1st,
>     2nd, 3rd, and Crew.
> -   Horizontal (x-) splines called **alluvia** span the **entire**
>     width of the plot. In this plot, each alluvium corresponds to a
>     fixed **strata** value of each axis variable, indicated by its
>     vertical position at the axis, as well as of the Survived
>     variable, indicated by its fill color.
> -   The segments of the **alluvia** between pairs of adjacent axes are
>     **flows**.
> -   The **alluvia** intersect the **strata** at **lodes**. The
>     **lodes** are not visualized in the above plot, but they can be
>     inferred as *filled rectangles* extending the flows through the
>     strata at each end of the plot or connecting the flows on either
>     side of the center stratum.



### Using ggsankeyfier

The `ggsankeyfier` also plots alluvial and sankey diagrams. This package takes data in **long-form**. See [this article.](https://pepijn-devries.github.io/ggsankeyfier/articles/data_management.html#wide-or-long-format). `ggsankeyfier` has builtin commands to convert data from wide to long: 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
```{r}
#| label: titanic-long-sankeyfier
#| eval: false

Titanic %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggsankeyfier::pivot_stages_longer(data=.,
      stages_from = c("Class", "Sex", "Age", "Survived"),
      values_from = "n",
      additional_aes_from = "Survived") -> Titanic_long
Titanic_long

```
:::
:::{.column}
```{r}
#| ref.label: titanic-long-sankeyfier
#| echo: false
```

:::
::::


This data is in long form, with `stages` defining the *axes* in the graph, and the `node` variable giving us *levels* within each (Qualitative) axis. The `edge_id` labels **both ends** (from and to) of each `connector` or edge/flow/alluvium. 

Let us plot this now:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
```{r}
#| label: titanic-ggsankeyfier
#| eval: false

Titanic_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stage, y = n, 
             group = node, connector = connector, 
             edge_id = edge_id)) +
    geom_sankeynode(v_space = "auto") +
    geom_sankeyedge(aes(fill = Survived), v_space = "auto") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    labs(x = "", title = "Titanic Survival")

```
:::
:::{.column}

```{r}
#| ref.label: titanic-ggsankeyfier
#| echo: false
```

:::
::::

### Using echarts4r

Let us make an interactive graph for this dataset using `echarts4`.


```{r}
#| label: ashtavakra
#| message: false
#| warning: false


ClassSex <- 
  Titanic %>% group_by(Class, Sex) %>% 
  summarise(cs = sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename("source" = Class, "target" = Sex, "value" = cs)
            
SexAge <- 
  Titanic %>% group_by(Sex,Age) %>% 
  summarise(sa = sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename("source" = Sex, "target" = Age, "value" = sa)

AgeSurvived <- 
  Titanic %>% group_by(Age,Survived) %>% 
  summarise(as = sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename("source" = Age, "target" = Survived, "value" = as)

Combo <- rbind(ClassSex, SexAge, AgeSurvived)
Combo

Combo %>% e_charts() %>% 
  e_sankey(source, target, value) %>% 
  e_title("Titanic: Who lived, and who didn't?") %>% 
  e_tooltip()

```


The process with `echarts4r` is quite different, since the data
structure used by this package is different:

-   The `echarts4r` package needs to have `source` and `target` columns
    for *axes*, along with a `value` to determine the *width* of the
    alluvium. 
-   The names in the source and target **can repeat, and can appear in
    both source and target columns** in order to create a multi-axis
    diagram. Hence the data needs to be inherently in **long** form.
-   However, for the **values**, we need to manually calculate the
    aggregate totals for alluvia between each consecutive pairs of axes
    (i.e Qual variables). This is not done automatically in `echarts4r`,
    but it is with `ggalluvial`.
-   So we create *grouped* aggregate *summaries* for each pair of
    Qualitative variables that we wish to plot *consecutively* ( i.e as
    axis1, axis2...)
-   Stack these pair-wise alluvia totals into one combo data frame using
    `rbind()`, after renaming the variables to "source", "target" and
    "value".

Phew! seems like too much work to do...I wonder if good, old-fashioned
`pivot-longer` will get us here...

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- Changes can be over `time`, or over "space"
- In the latter case, we can think of some Quantity changing over (multiple levels of) multiple Qualitative variables. E.g. `Sales` over `Product Type` over `Showroom Location` over `Festival Season`...
- When a *single Quant* varies over *a single multi-level Qual*, the Chord Diagram may be simpler than the Sankey/Alluvial. E.g `Bird` migration across `Multiple Locations`. This can even show bidirectional changes. ( Sankeys with loops are also possible, however)
- When you have a Quant that changes over only *one two-level Qual variable*, the Dumbbell plot becomes an option.


## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusion

We see that we can visualize "evolutions" over time and space. The
evolutions can represent changes in the **quantities** of things, or
their **categorical** affiliations or groups.

What business/design data would you depict in this way? Revenue streams? Employment? Expenditures over time and market? Migration? App usage patterns? There are many possibilities!

Note also that the [Bump Charts](/content/courses/Analytics/Descriptive/Modules/80-Ranking/index.qmd#bump-charts) are a special case of Alluvial/Sankey charts where each node connects/flows to **only** one other node.

## {{< iconify openmoji person >}} Your Turn

1.  Within the `ggalluvial` package are two datasets, `majors` and
    `vaccinations`. Plot alluvial charts for both of these.
2.  Go to the [American Life Panel
    Website](https://alpdata.rand.org/index.php?page=data) where you
    will find many public datasets. Try to take one and make charts from
    it that we have learned in this Module.
